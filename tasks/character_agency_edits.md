# Character Agency Edits

Comprehensive list of edits and additions for Books 1-2. All suggestions use action-based storytelling—physical behavior, dialogue, setting, and events that lead readers to conclusions rather than spelling them out.

## PARIS (HIGHEST PRIORITY - kills Achilles in Book 3 with zero setup)

### Book 1, Chapter 5 edits:
- During duel with Menelaus: Paris's eyes flick to the gap between them—the distance. His sword arm drops a fraction. Menelaus closes and Paris stumbles backward, always trying to create space that doesn't exist in sword range
- After Aphrodite rescues him: Add scene—Paris alone in a courtyard at night. He fires arrows at a mark on the far wall until his fingers bleed. Retrieves them. Fires again. Helen watches from a window. He doesn't notice her

### Book 1, Chapter 6 additions:
- Add POV section: Paris on the walls during Greek supply raids. His bow is in his hands. His fingers find the string when a Greek officer crosses into range. Hector's hand closes on his wrist. "Not him. Not yet." Paris lowers the bow. Watches the officer ride away
- Later in same section: A crow lands on the far parapet—sixty yards, maybe seventy. Paris draws and releases in one motion. The crow drops. A soldier nearby stares. Paris retrieves his arrow without comment

### Book 2, Chapter 2 edits:
- Augment wine-hall scene: Before the wine-hall, add Paris in an empty practice yard. Night. He's alone. Torch at the far end—a hundred paces. He shoots until he can split the flame. Then he goes to drink
- After the girl asks his name and he says "Corythus": She traces his fingers, the calluses. "These aren't from a sword." He pulls his hand back. "No. They're not."

### New scene needed (Book 2, Chapter 3 or new chapter):
- Skirmish at the walls. Greeks fall back. One officer rallies his men, shouting orders—three hundred yards out, well beyond spear range. Paris draws. The arrow rises, arcs, drops. The officer falls mid-word. Silence. Hector turns to look at Paris. Holds the look for a long moment. Says nothing. Walks away

## BRISEIS (Currently reactive - needs moments of choice)

### Book 2, Chapter 1 edits:
- Cellar scene: Footsteps above. Greek voices. Her mouth opens—and she bites down on her own hand instead. Hard enough to taste copper. She presses deeper into the shadows behind the wine jars. Waits
- When sorted with captives: She stands at the edge of the group while others wail. Her eyes move—counting tents, noting the rhythm of guard changes, marking where they keep the horses. A Greek soldier points at her. She doesn't flinch

### Book 2, Chapter 1 (nights with Achilles) edits:
- Before the shift at line 301: On the night before things change, he comes to her as always. But before he can reach for her, she speaks: "Why don't you sleep?" He goes still. She's never asked him anything. He lies down. Doesn't touch her. Doesn't answer. But he doesn't leave
- When she reaches back (line 320): Her hand finds the scar on his shoulder—but this time she presses it, deliberately. He pauses. Looks at her. She holds his gaze. Neither looks away

### Book 2, Chapter 3 additions:
- Add scene: Briseis in the captive women's area. An older woman is shivering, sick. Briseis pulls her own blanket off, wraps it around the woman's shoulders. Another captive whispers: "You'll freeze." Briseis: "I sleep in his tent. I won't freeze." The other women look at her differently after that

---

## ACHILLES (Reactive - things happen TO him)

### Book 1, Chapter 5 edits:
- Beach landing: After the first kills, Achilles pauses. Looks back at the ships. Patroclus stands at the prow of theirs, watching. Achilles holds the look for a breath—then turns toward the walls without waving

### Book 1, Chapter 6 additions:
- Add scene: War council. Agamemnon is describing the next raid target. Achilles interrupts: "Not the village. The supply depot." Agamemnon: "The village is closer." Achilles stands. "The depot." He leaves before Agamemnon can respond. The other kings watch him go

### Book 2, Chapter 1 edits:
- When he claims Briseis: His eyes pass over the screaming women, the ones who claw and wail. Stop on the one standing at the edge, arms wrapped around herself, silent. Staring at nothing. "That one." Patroclus: "She's in shock." Achilles: "I know."
- Add one active beat per section: When Achilles sits on the bed staring at nothing—have him pick up a knife and begin sharpening it. Methodical. The sound fills the silence. He's not doing nothing; he's preparing. Even if he doesn't know for what

### Book 2, Chapter 3 additions:
- During Palamedes stoning: Achilles watches from the back of the crowd. Patroclus stands beside him, jaw tight. "This is wrong." Achilles says nothing. Patroclus starts to push forward. Achilles's hand closes on his arm. Holds him in place. They watch until it's over

---

## HELEN (Passive suffering - needs small rebellions)

### Book 1, Chapter 5 edits:
- Wall scene during duel: A guard gestures to her cushioned seat. Helen remains standing at the parapet's edge. "I'll watch from here." Priam glances at her. She doesn't move. He waves the guard away
- When Paris falls and is rescued: The other women gasp, look away. Helen leans forward. Watches every moment of his retreat. Her face shows nothing

### Book 1, Chapter 6 additions:
- Add POV section: Helen descending the servant stairs alone, before dawn. She carries a bundle of cloth—bandages she cut herself from her own linens. The refugee quarters are cramped, dark. A woman recognizes her, starts to bow. Helen presses the cloth into her hands. "Don't tell anyone." She's gone before the woman can respond

### Book 2, Chapter 3 edits:
- Healing house scene: When Helen arrives, the healer looks surprised. "You came yesterday too." Helen rolls up her sleeves. "I'll come tomorrow." She chooses the worst cases—the ones others avoid
- Poppy for dying soldiers: A soldier is beyond saving, thrashing in agony. The healer moves to the next patient. Helen stays. Retrieves the poppy bottle herself. Measures the dose—more than enough. Holds the cup to his lips. His thrashing stops. She closes his eyes and moves to the next bed

---

## CASSANDRA (Exhausted prophet - needs moments of fight)

### Book 1, Chapter 5 edits:
- War council scene: Cassandra enters the chamber. The generals tense, expecting hysteria. Instead she speaks quietly, evenly: "Their supply depot at Tenedos is poorly guarded. Strike now and their siege breaks within the month." The generals look at each other. Polydamas clears his throat. "Perhaps we should—" Priam waves her away. She leaves without raising her voice

### Book 2, Chapter 2 edits:
- After Priam dismisses her: Cassandra doesn't go to her chamber. She finds a scribe in the lower halls. "Write this down. Everything I've told you." The scribe hesitates. "Princess, I can't—" She presses a gold ring into his palm. "Write it. Date it. Keep it somewhere safe." Later: the scribe's room is empty. The tablet, broken, lies in the courtyard

### Book 2, Chapter 3 additions:
- Add scene: Cassandra finds Andromache alone with Astyanax. She doesn't speak in riddles. "Take him. Tonight. Go to your father's people in the mountains." Andromache looks at her—really looks. "You've said this before." "I'll say it until you listen." Andromache's hand tightens on her son. She doesn't dismiss her. Doesn't agree. But she doesn't dismiss her

---

## HECTOR (Strong moderate agency - minor additions)

### Book 1, Chapter 6 edits:
- After receiving refugees: Hector turns to his aide. Points to the map. "Double the watch on the Scaean road. Send scouts to track their raiding patterns—where they go, how many, what they take. I want reports every three days." The aide nods. Hector looks back at the gates where the refugees entered. "And find room for them. Real room. Not the stables"

### Book 2, Chapter 1 additions:
- Add brief scene: Dawn. Hector on the walls with his captains. He points to the Greek camp. "They've moved their forges closer to the ships. Why?" A captain shrugs. Hector: "Find out. And reinforce the western approach. If they're building something, we need to know what"

### Book 2, Chapter 3 edits:
- Helmet scene with Astyanax: No changes. This is peak agency—removing his armor, choosing father over warrior. Perfect as written

---

## ODYSSEUS (MODEL - no major changes needed)

### Book 1, Chapter 6 edits:
- The tension with Palamedes is well-seeded. Minor addition: As Palamedes addresses the assembly about supply issues, Odysseus's hand moves to the pouch at his belt. His fingers trace the shape of something inside—a ring, perhaps. A seal. He smiles at something Palamedes says. The smile doesn't reach his eyes

### Book 2, Chapters 1-3:
- No changes needed. The Palamedes conspiracy is the template for how all characters should drive plot

---

## ANDROMACHE (Currently waiting - needs domestic agency)

### Book 1, Chapter 6 additions:
- Add brief scene: Hector enters their chambers. Andromache is directing two servants with grain sacks. "The north quarter first—the Lyrnessus refugees have children. Then the temple stores." She sees Hector, keeps talking: "And find Melanthios. His wife is sick. She needs a healer, not prayers." The servants leave. Only then does she turn to him

### Book 2, Chapter 1 edits:
- Expand her scene: When she says "You're always sorry," she's holding a pair of soft leather boots—baby-sized, half-finished. Her needle keeps moving as she speaks. "He took three steps today. He fell on the fourth." She holds up the boots. "He'll need these by next week. I'm making them myself. The cobbler's son died at Lyrnessus"

### Book 2, Chapter 3 additions:
- Add decision scene: A dispute in the refugee hall. Two families fighting over sleeping space. Andromache arrives before Hector's guards. She separates them, assigns new spaces, sends someone for food. A guard starts to intervene. She turns: "This is my house. I'll manage it." He steps back

---

## PRIAM (Passive figurehead - needs difficult choices)

### Book 1, Chapter 5 edits:
- Council scene: The generals argue. Priam listens. Finally he raises his hand. Silence. "We defend. No sorties. No attacks. We let them break themselves on our walls." Hector starts to object. Priam: "This is my decision." He's wrong—but he decides

### Book 2, Chapter 2 edits:
- When dismissing Cassandra: She tells him about the snake swallowing its tail. Priam's hand rises toward her face—the old gesture, the father's touch. It stops. Hangs in the air. Falls to his side. "Get some rest." He turns away before she does

### Book 2, Chapter 3 additions:
- Add adjudication scene: Two merchants, a dispute over grain prices during siege. Priam on his throne, listening. Both make their case. He rules: "Prices stay fixed. Anyone who hoards will answer to me." One merchant protests. Priam's voice hardens: "This is Troy. Not your counting house. Leave." The merchant leaves

---

## AGAMEMNON (Angry authority - needs strategic moments)

### Book 1, Chapter 5 edits:
- Add command scene: War council before the landing. Agamemnon at the head of the table, moving markers on a map. "Ajax takes the left flank. Diomedes holds the center with his chariots. Achilles—" He looks at the empty seat. Moves the marker anyway. "—takes the beach first. As always." His voice is flat. The other kings don't look at each other

### Book 1, Chapter 6 edits:
- During supply crisis: Agamemnon summoning quartermasters, demanding numbers. "How many days of grain? How many cattle?" The numbers are bad. He sweeps a cup off the table. Then: "Find more. Raid further inland. And cut rations for the auxiliary troops—the allies can feed their own men." Not good leadership. But he's trying something

### Book 2, Chapter 2 edits:
- Palamedes trial: Agamemnon reads the letter. Looks at the gold. He could ask questions. Instead he stands taller. "The evidence is clear. He will face judgment." He's performing—but he believes he's in charge. "Take him. Hold him until the army decides his fate." He doesn't look at Odysseus when he gives the order

## PRIORITY ORDER FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. **PARIS** - Most urgent. Without bow-skill scenes, his killing of Achilles will feel random
2. **BRISEIS** - Her arc is central to Book 2; needs moments of choice within constraint
3. **ACHILLES** - Protagonist needs active decisions, not just reactions
4. **HELEN** - Her passivity undermines thematic weight; small rebellions add depth
5. **CASSANDRA** - One connection scene transforms her from tragic prop to tragic agent
6. **ANDROMACHE** - Quick wins; domestic agency scenes are easy to add
7. **PRIAM** - Few lines of decision-making would help
8. **AGAMEMNON** - Background authority needs grounding
9. **HECTOR** - Already strong; minor additions only
10. **ODYSSEUS** - No changes needed; he's the model
