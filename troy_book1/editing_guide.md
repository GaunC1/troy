# Editing Guide: Troy Book 1

## Core Principle
Replace indirect, decorative prose with direct action. Trust the reader. Show, don't tell.

## What to Cut or Replace

### 1. Stacked Similes
Multiple similes in sequence dilute impact. Keep one or zero.

**Before:** "the smile went through Paris like a blade, like a song, like the first drink of water after days in the desert"
**After:** "Paris forgot to breathe"

**Before:** "beautiful in the way that a fire is beautiful, in the way that a cliff-edge is beautiful"
**After:** Cut entirely — "Looking at them hurt" already does the work

### 2. Abstract/Vague Descriptions
Replace poetic abstraction with concrete physical detail.

**Before:** "a spear that seemed to exist in more dimensions than the world allowed"
**After:** "a spear that flickered at its edges"

**Before:** "Something older. Something that made the air taste of copper and honey and fear"
**After:** Cut — the scene establishes divinity through action

### 3. Explaining Emotions After Showing Them
If action/dialogue shows the emotion, don't narrate it.

**Before:** "Paris hadn't moved. He was still watching her. And now there was something else in his expression—confusion, wonder—as if he too had felt something pass between them and didn't understand what it was."
**After:** "Paris hadn't moved. He was still watching her."

**Before:** "She was looking back at Paris with something broken open in her expression, something that had been locked away and was now spilling out like wine from a cup."
**After:** "She was looking back at Paris."

### 4. Characters Explaining Mechanics
Let effects demonstrate themselves rather than having characters explain.

**Before:** "The curse. It's pulling the knowledge out of you like thread from a spindle. In a moment you won't remember why you're upset. You'll just know that your strange sister said something disturbing, and you'll feel sorry for me, and you'll leave."
**After:** "I can see it happening."
(Followed by Hector's "What were we talking about?" which shows the effect)

### 5. Backstory/Exposition Dumps
Cut context that isn't immediately necessary.

**Before:** "Eris threw it among us at a wedding feast. A petty cruelty. But the insult stands until it is resolved."
**After:** Cut — the apple's inscription and the judgment are enough

### 6. Narrator Commentary
Cut lines where the narrator editorializes or underlines meaning.

**Before:** "Looked at the city that was already burning, if you knew how to see it. 'And so it begins,' she said to no one."
**After:** Cut — the ironic juxtaposition with the celebration carries the weight

### 7. Decorative Similes That Add Nothing
Simple similes that don't earn their place.

**Before:** "dissolving like mist at sunrise"
**After:** Cut — "The goddesses were going" is sufficient

**Before:** "no shade worth the name"
**After:** "no shade"

## What to Keep

- **Physical reactions** that show emotion (trembling hands, forgotten breath, tightened throat)
- **Dialogue** that reveals character
- **Single, earned similes** that add genuine meaning
- **Concrete sensory detail** (what characters see, hear, smell)
- **Action and movement**
- **Silence and restraint** — what's unsaid often matters more

---

## Character-Specific Notes

- **Cassandra's visions**: Use fragmentary, imagistic prose. Cut explanations of what visions mean.
- **Divine/mythic scenes**: Restraint is more powerful. Gods should feel alien through behavior, not description.
- **Helen/Paris romance**: Physical reactions only. No narration of "what passed between them."
- **Hector**: His voice is already lean. Preserve this.

## Process

1. Read each scene
2. Identify simile clusters (2+ in close proximity)
3. Identify narrator explaining what the scene already shows
4. Identify characters explaining mechanics/magic/prophecy
5. Identify abstract descriptions that could be concrete
6. Make targeted cuts/replacements
7. Re-read to ensure meaning is preserved
