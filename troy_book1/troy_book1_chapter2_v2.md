## PARIS

The garden was silver in the moonlight, the fountain's murmur the only sound.

Paris had been walking for an hour, maybe more. The palace corridors all looked the same to him—white stone, painted columns, servants who bowed and wouldn't meet his eyes. He had found a door that led outside and taken it without thinking, desperate for air that didn't smell of torch smoke and perfume.

He didn't know the garden was hers until he saw her.

She was sitting on the fountain's edge, her back to him, her hair unbound. Without the gold and the gown and the careful arrangement of queenship, she looked smaller. Younger. Human.

He should leave. He knew he should leave. But his feet carried him forward, and the gravel crunched beneath his sandals, and she turned.

"Prince Paris."

"Queen Helen." He stopped a few paces away. "I didn't mean to—I can go."

"No." She looked down at her hands, folded in her lap. "Stay. If you like."

He sat on the fountain's edge, an arm's length between them. The water splashed softly behind them. Somewhere in the palace, a dog barked once and fell silent.

"I couldn't sleep," he said.

"No."

"The bed is too soft. I keep—" He laughed, a short, embarrassed sound. "I keep rolling into the middle. On the mountain I slept on the ground. Wool blanket over rocks. This is—"

"Different."

"Yes."

They sat in silence. The moon moved behind a cloud, then emerged again.

"How long?" Helen asked. "On the mountain."

"Twenty years. Since I was an infant." He picked at a loose thread on his tunic. "My father—King Priam—he ordered me killed. A prophecy. I would bring destruction to Troy." He glanced at her. "The servant couldn't do it. He left me on the mountainside instead. A shepherd found me. Raised me."

"And now you're a prince."

"Now I'm a prince." The word felt strange in his mouth. "I don't know how to do it. Everyone keeps waiting for me to—to *be* something. To know things. I don't know anything. I know how to birth a lamb in a snowstorm. I know which roots you can eat and which will kill you. I know how to be alone." He stopped. "I'm sorry. You don't want to hear this."

"I do."

He looked at her. She was watching him with an expression he couldn't read.

"Why?" he asked.

"Because you're not pretending." She turned back to the fountain. "Everyone here pretends. They say what they're supposed to say. They do what they're supposed to do. Even when they're alone, they're performing. Practicing for the next time they're not alone." Her voice was quiet. "I've been performing for so long I don't remember what's underneath."

Paris didn't say anything. He waited.

"When I was twelve, a man took me from my home. Kept me in a tower for months. Did things." She said it simply, without affect, the way one might describe the weather. "My brothers killed him eventually, brought me back. And everyone said, 'How wonderful, Helen is safe, Helen is home.' And I smiled and said yes, wonderful, home. And then the suitors came, and my father gave me to Menelaus, and I smiled and said yes, wonderful, marriage. And I've been smiling ever since."

A nightbird called from somewhere in the garden. The fountain splashed.

"Menelaus is kind," Helen said. "Everyone tells me how lucky I am. He doesn't beat me. He doesn't—" She shook her head. "He's kind. And I feel nothing. I've felt nothing for years. I thought that was just how it was. Something broken inside me that couldn't be fixed."

"And now?"

She looked at him. The moon caught her eyes, made them silver.

"Now I don't know."

Paris wanted to touch her. Her hand, her face, anything. He kept his hands at his sides.

"I should go," Helen said. She stood, pulled her shawl around her shoulders. "It's late."

"Yes."

She walked past him, close enough that he could smell her—not perfume, just skin and hair and something clean like rainwater. At the edge of the garden she stopped.

"Paris."

"Yes?"

"Thank you. For not pretending."

She was gone before he could answer.

---

Five days later, the palace felt different.

Paris noticed it at breakfast—a certain looseness in the servants, a quiet that wasn't quite silence. Menelaus had left that morning for a hunting trip. Paris had watched from his window as the party rode out at dawn: the king in high spirits, his men laughing, his dogs running circles around the horses.

Now the palace breathed easier. Or perhaps Paris only imagined it.

He found her on the walls that night, looking out at the harbor.

The wind pulled at her hair, her dress. She didn't turn when he approached. Below them, the *Aedon* rocked at anchor, her crew making final preparations for the morning's departure.

"We sail at dawn," he said.

"I know."

He stood beside her, close but not touching. The sea smell was strong here—salt and seaweed and something deeper, older.

"Come with me."

She didn't move.

"Helen. Come with me to Troy."

"You don't know what you're asking."

"I know exactly what I'm asking." He turned to face her. "I'm asking you to leave everything. Your home. Your husband. Your—" He stopped. "Everything. I'm asking you to walk onto a ship with a man you've known for eight days and sail across the sea to a city you've never seen."

"Then why ask?"

"Because I think you're dying here." His voice was raw. "I think you've been dying for years, so slowly you didn't notice. And I think—" He reached out, almost touched her face, pulled back. "I think maybe I'm dying too. And maybe together we could—"

"Don't." She closed her eyes. "Don't say it."

"Helen."

"If you say it, I'll have to answer. And I don't—I can't—"

She was shaking. He could see it in her shoulders, her hands.

"The ship is the *Aedon*. Far end of the harbor, past the fishing boats. We cast off at first light." He stepped back. "I won't ask again. If you're not there, I'll understand."

He walked away. He didn't look back.

## HELEN

The morning was cool, the courtyard loud with dogs and horses and men.

Helen stood on the steps of the palace, wrapped in her shawl, watching her husband prepare to leave. His favorite hounds milled around his legs—great grey beasts, scarred and eager. His men were loading spears onto a wagon, provisions onto mules. The hunting party numbered perhaps twenty, enough to track and kill and carry home whatever they found.

Menelaus was happy. She could see it in the way he moved, the way he laughed at something one of his men said. He loved the hunt the way other men loved wine or women—completely, uncritically, with his whole self. It was the one time he seemed truly present.

He climbed the steps toward her, still grinning.

"Ten days," he said. "Maybe twelve if the boar leads us a chase. The shrine-keeper at Artemis's grove says they've seen a massive one near the sacred spring. Old and cunning." He kissed her forehead, a quick, distracted gesture. "You'll manage our guests?"

"Of course."

"Good, good. Paris seems decent enough. Bit quiet. But you've drawn him out—I've seen you talking at the feasts." He squeezed her shoulder. "It suits you, you know. Being lively. You should do it more often."

Helen smiled. "Safe hunting."

"Always." He was already turning away, already back in his own head, already planning the chase. "I'll bring you back a tusk. Have the servants prepare the smoking room—we'll need it."

She watched him mount, watched him wave, watched the party clatter out through the gates. The dogs ran ahead, baying. The horses' hooves kicked up dust that hung in the morning air.

She stood on the steps until they disappeared around the bend in the road.

*You've drawn him out*, he'd said. *It suits you.*

He had no idea. He looked at her every day and saw exactly what he expected to see: his wife, his queen, his beautiful possession, finally warming to her role. It had never occurred to him that she might be warming to something else.

The courtyard was emptying. Servants returning to their work, guards resuming their posts. The dust was settling.

Helen turned and walked back into the palace.

---

The days blurred.

A glance across the courtyard as Paris walked with his men. His eyes finding hers, holding for a moment, then sliding away.

A conversation in the corridor, voices low, saying nothing that mattered. But the way he listened. The way he leaned toward her when she spoke.

An afternoon on the terrace, Helen with her weaving, Paris below in the courtyard practicing sword forms. He was clumsy—a shepherd playing at soldier. She watched him fail and fail and fail, and something in her chest ached. He looked up. Caught her watching. Grinned.

A shell pressed into her palm as they passed each other near the kitchens. Small, spiral, cream-colored with flecks of pink. "From the beach," he whispered, and then he was gone.

She kept it in a box beneath her bed. At night, alone in the chambers she normally shared with her husband, she held it and tried to understand what was happening to her.

She felt like a woman waking from a long sleep. Colors seemed brighter. Sounds seemed sharper. She caught herself smiling at nothing—at sunlight on stone, at the smell of bread, at the particular blue of the sky.

Menelaus had never made her feel this way. Menelaus had never made her feel anything.

And now he was gone, hunting boar in Artemis's sacred grove, and Paris was here, and the ship was leaving tomorrow, and Helen lay awake in the dark and felt the walls of her careful life beginning to crack.

---

She went to Hermione's chamber after midnight.

The girl was sleeping. Nine years old, small for her age, her red hair spread across the pillow like her father's. She slept with her mouth slightly open, one hand curled beside her face.

Helen knelt beside the bed.

She had not been a good mother. She knew this. She had held Hermione as an infant and felt—nothing. Had watched her grow and learn and become a person and felt—nothing. The same nothing she felt for Menelaus, for the palace, for her entire life.

But looking at her daughter now, in the lamplight, she felt something. A twist in her chest. A tightness in her throat.

She reached out. Her hand hovered over Hermione's hair.

If she stayed, she would watch this girl grow up. Would see her married off to some prince or king, traded for an alliance, learning to smile and say *yes, wonderful*. Would watch her daughter become what she had become: a beautiful shell with nothing inside.

If she left—

Helen pulled her hand back.

She didn't know what would happen if she left. That was the point. For the first time in her life, she didn't know what came next.

She stood. Looked at her daughter one more time.

Then she walked out of the room, and she didn't look back.

---

The harbor was dark, the ships black shapes against grey sky.

Helen moved through the streets like a ghost, her cloak pulled over her hair, her sandals silent on the stones. A dog watched her pass. A drunk muttered in a doorway. The city slept.

She found the *Aedon* at the far end of the harbor. Men were moving on deck, making ready to sail. Torches flickered.

On the dock below, Aeneas was directing sailors loading cargo. Chests—heavy, iron-banded, carried two men to a piece. One after another, hauled up the gangplank and into the hold.

Helen stopped.

She knew those chests. She had seen them in the treasury, in the locked room beneath the palace where Menelaus kept the wealth of Sparta. Gold. Silver. Cups and plates and jewelry that had been her dowry, her family's for generations.

Aeneas saw her watching. Their eyes met. His expression didn't change. He turned back to his work, directed another chest up the gangplank.

She understood. This wasn't a rescue. It wasn't a romance. It was a theft—of her, yes, but also of everything else. Paris might think he was saving her. Aeneas knew what they would need: funding for a new life, bribes for allies, resources for a war.

She could turn back. The thought flickered and died.

Helen walked up the gangplank.

Paris was waiting at the rail. His face when he saw her—relief, joy, terror, all tangled together. He reached for her hand. She took it.

"You came."

"Yes."

The sailors cast off. The oars bit water. The *Aedon* pulled away from the dock.

In the distance, far up the coast where the hunting party must have camped, dogs began to bark. Menelaus's hounds, catching some scent on the wind. Helen wondered if they could smell her leaving.

She watched Sparta shrink. The dock. The market. The road to the palace. The room where her daughter was sleeping.

Paris's hand tightened on hers.

She had made her choice—or the choice had made itself, had been made the moment their eyes met across the feast table, had been made years ago when the gods decided she would be the most beautiful woman in the world and therefore the most owned.

But this time, for the first time, she had walked onto the ship herself.

The sun rose. Sparta vanished into haze.

Helen watched the horizon and did not look back.

## HECTOR

The blow caught him across the ribs.

"Better." Hector stepped back, lowered his practice sword. "But you're dropping your shoulder. It tells me where you're going."

The young soldier nodded, breathing hard.

"Again."

They circled each other in the practice yard. The morning sun beat down. Around them, other pairs sparred—the clack of wood on wood punctuating the air. Hector had been here since dawn, working through the recruits one by one.

The soldier lunged. Hector parried, stepped aside, tapped him on the back of the head.

"Dead. Again."

A messenger appeared at the edge of the yard.

Hector saw him—dusty, travel-worn, waiting. He finished the drill first. Disarmed the soldier, sent him sprawling.

"Work on the shoulder."

He crossed to the messenger. The man was Trojan—one of the fast riders who carried news between allied cities. His horse was lathered and trembling.

"Prince Hector." The messenger held out a scroll. "From Sparta. Urgent."

Hector broke the seal.

*...the queen of Sparta...*

*...departed in the night...*

*...treasury emptied, the wealth of three generations...*

*...your brother Prince Paris...*

He read it twice. His face did not change.

"Any reply, my lord?"

"No. Go to the kitchens. Rest."

The messenger left. Hector stood alone in the practice yard, the scroll in his hand.

Around him, the sparring continued. Wood on wood. Grunts of effort.

"My lord?" A captain, approaching. "The next group is ready."

"Have them run the walls. Full armor."

"Yes, my lord."

The yard emptied. Hector read the message one more time.

Then he walked to the walls.

---

Andromache found him at dawn, in the same spot where she'd left him.

She didn't ask if he'd slept. She stood beside him, her shawl around her shoulders, and looked out at the sea.

"The whole city knows," she said. "Servants talk."

"Yes."

"Your father is composing a response. Your mother has taken to her chambers." A pause. "Paris's ship was sighted this morning. He'll be here by midday."

Hector said nothing.

"Can we give her back? Before they come for her?"

"If it were only the woman, perhaps." Hector's voice was flat. "Menelaus might negotiate. Might even be relieved—the marriage was not happy."

"But?"

"But Paris took their gold. Their silver. The wealth of Sparta's treasury." He turned to look at her. His eyes were red-rimmed. "You can forgive a man who steals your wife. You cannot forgive a man who makes you look like a fool."

Andromache was silent. Below them, the city was waking—merchants setting up stalls, children in the streets, the smell of bread rising.

"How bad?"

"Menelaus will call on his allies. Every man who swore the oath."

"What oath?"

"When Helen's father was choosing her husband, he made all the suitors swear to defend whoever won her. To come to his aid if anyone tried to take her." Hector laughed, bitter. "Every king and prince in Greece, bound by sacred oath. And now my brother has given them reason to collect."

Andromache's hand found his.

"How long do we have?"

"A year. Maybe less." He looked at the horizon. "They'll need time to gather. A thousand ships, the rumors say. A hundred thousand men. But they'll come. Agamemnon has wanted an excuse to move against us for years. Now Paris has handed him one wrapped in gold."

"Then we prepare."

"Yes."

"Hector." She waited until he looked at her. "The walls have never fallen."

"The gods have already abandoned us." He pulled his hand free, gently. "They sent Paris back. They let him choose the goddess of love over the goddess of war. They've made their position clear."

He turned from the sea.

"I need to speak with my father. Rationing, weapons, the outer walls. The harbor defenses—"

"Hector."

He stopped.

Andromache crossed to him, took his face in her hands.

"One moment," she said. "Before you become the prince again."

He closed his eyes.

"I wanted to kill him," he said quietly. "When I read the message. Wait at the harbor and cut him down before he set foot on the dock."

"Why didn't you?"

"Because he's my brother. Because Father would never forgive me." He opened his eyes. "Because Cassandra told me to. Three weeks ago, before he left. She begged me to kill him. Said he would destroy us all."

"And you didn't believe her."

"I couldn't. The words slipped away even as she spoke them. I could see how much she meant it, how desperate she was, and I just—" He shook his head. "I couldn't hold onto it."

"The curse."

"Yes." He stepped back from her hands. "And now here we are."

He kissed her forehead. Then he was gone, his footsteps receding down the stairs.

Andromache stayed on the walls.

Waited.

---

The ship came at midday.

Hector watched from the walls as it rounded the headland, sail full, the Trojan standard flying. The harbor was crowded—word had spread, and half the city had come to welcome the prince home.

They cheered. Waved cloth, threw flowers. They didn't know yet.

Hector could see Paris at the prow, waving. He looked happy.

And beside him, the woman. Even at this distance, Hector could see why men might go to war for her.

The ship reached the dock. Ropes thrown, gangplank lowered.

The chests came first. One after another, iron-banded, heavy, loaded onto waiting carts. The crowd murmured—impressed, curious. The wealth of Sparta, paraded through Troy.

Then Paris descended, Helen on his arm. The crowd pressed close. Laughter, questions, pointing at the foreign woman.

A boy tugged at Helen's dress. She looked down at him, and her face did something complicated—something that might have been pain. Then someone pulled the boy away.

Hector turned from the wall.

He couldn't watch. He had preparations to make, a father to convince. Killing Paris now would change nothing. The theft was done. The insult delivered.

They were committed. All of them.

He descended the stairs and did not look back.

## CASSANDRA

The golden thread. She could see it now.

Cassandra pressed her forehead against the cool stone of her window frame and watched doom walk through the gates of Troy.

In the vision three weeks ago, the thread had been abstract—a shimmering line connecting Paris to a woman she'd never seen, stretching from Mount Ida to Sparta to here. Now the thread had flesh. Golden hair. A face that made men forget their names.

Helen.

She was beautiful. Even from this distance, even through Cassandra's exhausted eyes, she was beautiful in the way a forest fire was beautiful—mesmerizing, inevitable, consuming everything it touched.

The crowd cheered. They threw flowers. They had no idea what they were welcoming through their gates.

Cassandra watched the chests being unloaded. The stolen gold of Sparta, paraded past celebrating Trojans. She watched Paris helping Helen down the gangplank, his face shining with the particular stupidity of a man who thinks love excuses everything.

And then Helen looked up.

Across the harbor, across the crowd, across all that distance—their eyes met.

Cassandra felt it like a blade between her ribs. Recognition. Not of faces—they'd never seen each other before. Recognition of something deeper. Two women who could see clearly, trapped in a world that refused to look.

*You know*, Cassandra thought. *You can feel it too. The weight of what you've brought through those gates.*

Helen's face did something complicated. Fear, maybe. Or the beginning of understanding.

Then Paris touched her arm, said something, and Helen looked away. The connection broke.

Cassandra stayed at the window, watching the celebration, watching the golden thread wind itself tighter around Troy's throat.

*The lamb won't hear the butcher*, she thought. *It never does.*

She had tried to stop this. Begged Hector to kill Paris before he could leave for Sparta. Watched her brother's eyes go blank as the curse pulled the warning from his mind.

She wouldn't try again. What was the point? The doom was here now, walking through the streets, smiling and waving at the people it would kill.

All Cassandra could do was watch.

---

On the dock, Helen stumbled.

Paris caught her arm. "Are you all right?"

She was staring up at the city—at the white walls, the towers, the palace. At one tower in particular, on the eastern edge, where a window stood dark.

Not dark. There was a face. Pale, framed by black hair.

Helen met those eyes across the distance and felt something cold move through her. Recognition, though she'd never seen this woman. Understanding, though no words passed.

*She knows. Everything. How this ends.*

"Helen?" Paris again. "What is it?"

Helen tore her gaze from the tower. Forced herself to smile.

"Nothing. Just the sun."

Behind them, the sailors finished with the chests. Above them, Cassandra's window stood silent.

The celebration continued long into the night.

*End of Chapter Two*
