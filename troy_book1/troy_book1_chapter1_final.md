## PARIS

The goddesses came to him at midday, when the sheep were stupid with heat and the mountain offered no shade worth the name.

Paris had been sleeping against a rock, his crook across his knees, dreaming of white walls and great gates. He woke to light.

Not sunlight. Something older. Something that made the air taste of copper and honey and fear.

Three women stood before him. They were naked, or clothed in something that moved like water and concealed nothing. They were beautiful in the way that a fire is beautiful, in the way that a cliff-edge is beautiful. Looking at them hurt.

"Alexandros," said the first. She was taller than the others, and her eyes were the grey of storm-clouds, and she held a spear that seemed to exist in more dimensions than the world allowed. "Called Paris. Son of Priam, prince of Troy, shepherd of Ida. You will judge between us."

Paris tried to stand. His legs would not obey him. He tried to speak. His tongue was sand.

"Hera," said the grey-eyed one, gesturing to the woman on her left—golden-haired, imperious, looking at Paris the way his father's steward looked at the accounts. "Aphrodite." The woman on her right smiled, and the smile went through Paris like a blade, like a song, like the first drink of water after days in the desert. "And I am Athena. We require your judgment."

"I—" Paris's voice cracked. "I am a shepherd. I tend sheep on a mountain. I am no one."

"You are the son of Priam. Exposed on the mountain to die because of your mother's dream. Found by a herdsman. Raised as his own. But still the blood of kings runs through you, and the blood of kings is what we require. A mortal judge, of royal lineage, unentangled with any of us. You are the only one who qualifies."

"The dream," Paris said. He knew this story—his foster father had told it to him once, drunk on winter wine. A queen dreaming of a burning torch. Priests demanding blood. An infant left on the mountainside to die. "What was the dream?"

"That you would destroy Troy." Athena's voice was flat, disinterested. "This is irrelevant to our current needs. Judge between us."

"Judge what?"

Hera held up an apple. It was gold, or something like gold, and it glowed with its own light, and there was writing on it in a script Paris could not read.

"For the fairest," said Hera. "Eris threw it among us at a wedding feast. A petty cruelty. But the insult stands until it is resolved. You will look upon us and decide which of us deserves the apple."

Paris looked at the three of them. At their terrible beauty. At the spear in Athena's hand, the golden light around Hera's brow, the smile still playing at Aphrodite's lips.

"If I choose wrong—"

"Then two of us will be displeased with you." Athena shrugged. "One of us will be displeased regardless. Such is the nature of judgment. But we will sweeten the choice."

She stepped forward. Paris flinched, but she only knelt before him, bringing her grey eyes level with his.

"Choose me," she said, "and I will give you wisdom beyond any mortal. Victory in every battle. You will never lose a war, Paris of Troy. You will conquer kingdoms and your name will ring through the ages as the greatest warrior who ever lived."

She stepped back. Hera took her place.

"Choose me," said the queen of heaven, "and I will give you power beyond imagining. Kingdoms will bow to you. You will rule not just Troy but all of Asia, all of Greece, all the lands from the rising to the setting sun. Kings will be your servants and their crowns will be your toys."

She stepped back. Aphrodite came forward.

She did not kneel. She simply stood before him, close enough that he could smell her—roses, and the sea, and something underneath that was purely, devastatingly female.

"I will give you love," she said. Her voice was lower than the others, softer. "The most beautiful woman in the world. Helen of Sparta. She will be yours, Paris. She will come to you willingly, and she will love you until the day she dies, and every night you will fall asleep in her arms and every morning you will wake to her face."

Paris's throat tightened. He thought of the cold winters on the mountain. The silence that stretched for days. The way he sometimes talked to the sheep just to hear a voice, even his own.

"Her," he said, pointing to Aphrodite. "The apple is hers."

Athena's face went still. Hera's twisted with fury. But Aphrodite—Aphrodite smiled at him with such warmth, such gratitude, such promise, that for a moment Paris truly believed he had made the right choice.

"The woman you want is in Sparta," Aphrodite said. "Go to your father. Reclaim your birthright. He will send you to Greece as an ambassador. The rest will follow."

The light began to fade. The goddesses were going, dissolving like mist at sunrise.

"Wait," Paris called. "The dream—my mother's dream—will I destroy Troy?"

Athena's voice came from very far away, or perhaps from inside his own skull: "You already have."

---

Paris woke in the afternoon shade, alone.

The sheep had scattered across the hillside. A hawk circled overhead, riding the thermals. The rock he'd been leaning against was warm against his back, solid, real.

He looked at his hands. Turned them over. Pressed his palms against the rock until the edges bit into his skin.

Just a dream. The sun and the heat playing tricks.

He stood. Walked to the ridge where he could see the whole valley spread out below—the brown hills, the distant gleam of water, and there, on the horizon, the white walls of Troy catching the last of the daylight.

He had seen those walls a thousand times. Had imagined walking through the gates, climbing the steps to the palace, standing before the father who had ordered him killed. In the dreams, his father always turned to look at him. The look was always—

Paris started walking.

He left the sheep. Left his crook lying in the dirt, his cloak hanging from a branch, his water skin half-empty by the rock. He walked down the mountain as the sun sank behind him, and he did not look back.

## CASSANDRA

She woke with her nails digging into her palms, blood welling in the crescents.

The servants didn't come anymore. She had screamed too many nights, and they had learned that nothing they did helped, and eventually they had stopped trying. Her chamber was in the east tower now, far from her siblings, far from her parents, far from anyone who might hear.

Cassandra uncurled her fingers and watched the blood bead on her palms. The pain helped. It anchored her to the present, to this body, to this room with its stone walls and its narrow window and its single guttering lamp.

The vision was already fading. Fire—there was always fire. Walls breached, gates torn, the palace burning. But something else tonight. Something new.

A shepherd on a mountain. Three figures of light. An apple changing hands.

She rose from her bed, her legs unsteady beneath her. Crossed to the window. Looked out at the city spread below.

Troy slept. Torches flickered on the walls where the night watch made their rounds. Dogs barked in the lower city. Somewhere a baby cried, thin and distant.

And there—far beyond the walls, in the darkness where the mountains rose against the stars—a single figure walking. She couldn't possibly see him at this distance. But she saw him anyway. Her brother, the shepherd, the prince, the doom, descending from Mount Ida with the taste of honey and copper still on his tongue.

She went to the door and opened it.

The guards straightened. Their hands moved toward their spears before they recognized her—a reflex, quickly stifled. The mad princess. Not dangerous, just sad.

"Princess." The younger one's voice was careful. "Is everything—"

"My brother Paris is coming home. He'll be at the gates by morning."

The guards exchanged a look.

"Princess," the older one said, "your brother Paris died as an infant. The king ordered—"

"The king ordered him exposed. The servant disobeyed. He's been living on Mount Ida for twenty years, tending sheep. Tonight he started walking." She watched their faces, watched the confusion there, the beginning of something that might have been doubt. "When he arrives, you should kill him."

The younger guard's mouth opened. Closed.

"I'm sorry," the older one said. "Kill—?"

"Kill him. Before he enters the city. It's the only way." She held his gaze, willed him to hear her, to believe. "If you let him through those gates, everyone you love will die. Your wives. Your children. Everyone."

The older guard's face softened into something worse than disbelief: pity. He glanced at his companion—*you see what I deal with*—then back at Cassandra.

"Should I send for someone, Princess? Your mother, perhaps—"

"No." She stepped back into her chamber. "It wouldn't matter."

She closed the door. Stood in the darkness, breathing.

The lamb won't hear the butcher, she thought. It never does.

---

Hector came at midmorning.

She heard his footsteps in the corridor—always the same rhythm, measured and deliberate. Her brother walked like a soldier even in peacetime. Perhaps because he had never known peacetime, not really. The Trojans had been fighting someone for as long as Cassandra could remember. Hector had been fighting longer than that.

He knocked. She didn't answer, but he entered anyway.

"Cassandra." He stood in the doorway, helmet under his arm, still in his armor from the morning drills. "You've heard?"

"That my dead brother isn't dead? Yes."

"It's really him. The birthmark on his shoulder. The way he—" Hector stopped. "Father is beside himself. Mother won't stop weeping. The whole city is celebrating."

"I know."

Through the window, she could hear it—drums in the streets, songs drifting up from the market district. The lost prince returned. The gods' blessing made manifest.

Hector crossed the room and sat on the edge of her bed. He did this sometimes, when he visited. Sat close enough to touch but never touching. Her brother the protector, who couldn't protect her from anything that mattered.

"You told the guards he was coming," he said. "Hours before anyone knew."

"Yes."

"You told them to kill him."

She turned from the window to face him. "Will you?"

"Will I what?"

"Kill him. Paris." She watched his face, looking for any crack in the composure, any hint that her words were landing somewhere real. "You're the only one who could. The only one with the authority, the ability. If you went to him tonight—"

"Cassandra."

"—made it look like an accident, a fall from the walls, poison in his wine—"

"Cassandra." His voice sharpened. "He's our brother."

"He's the end of everything." She crossed to him, knelt at his feet, gripped his hands in hers. They were rough, calloused, a soldier's hands. She had held these hands when she was a child, before Apollo's gift, before everything. "Listen to me. For once in your life, really listen. I have seen what happens if he stays. The walls breached. The gates torn down. Father dead on the altar. Your son—"

She felt his hands twitch in hers.

"Astyanax. They throw him from the walls, Hector. The Greeks. After you're dead, after Troy falls, they take your son and they—"

"Stop." He pulled his hands free. His face had changed—something raw there, something almost like fear. "Stop it."

"You felt that. Just now. You believed me."

He stood. Walked to the window. She watched his shoulders rise and fall, watched him press his palms against the stone frame.

"Hector."

"Paris is our brother." His voice was strange. Thick. "He was taken from us. He's come home. I can't—I won't—"

"You're already forgetting." She stood, followed him to the window. "I can see it happening. The curse. It's pulling the knowledge out of you like thread from a spindle. In a moment you won't remember why you're upset. You'll just know that your strange sister said something disturbing, and you'll feel sorry for me, and you'll leave."

"That's not—" He turned to face her. His eyes were clouded, confused. "What were we talking about?"

Cassandra laughed. It came out broken, jagged.

"You should rest," Hector said. His voice was gentle again, all the sharpness gone. "I'll have the servants bring you something to eat. It's been an exciting day."

He squeezed her shoulder—the most contact he ever allowed himself—and left. His footsteps receded down the corridor. Measured. Deliberate. A soldier's walk.

Cassandra stayed at the window.

Far below, in the palace courtyard, she could see her family gathered around the stranger who was their son, their brother, their doom. Her father embracing him. Her mother weeping into his shoulder. Paris standing stiff and overwhelmed, not yet comfortable in his royal clothes.

She pressed her forehead against the cool stone and closed her eyes.

## HELEN

"—and the northern route adds six days, but you avoid the pirates off Lesbos entirely."

"Six days." Menelaus shook his head, gesturing with his cup. Wine sloshed over the rim. "Six days is six days' worth of spoilage. Olive oil doesn't care about pirates."

"Ah, but your merchants might." This from Aeneas, the Trojan prince's companion—sharp-faced, watchful, doing most of the diplomatic work while the prince himself sat quiet. "A living merchant with delayed cargo is worth more than a dead merchant with timely cargo, surely."

Laughter around the table. Menelaus laughed loudest.

Helen sat beside her husband in her finest gown with gold in her hair. She had smiled when expected, nodded when appropriate, and eaten nothing. The roasted lamb sat cooling on her plate. Across the hall, a dog fight had broken out over scraps, and two servants were trying to separate them without getting bitten.

"Prince Paris." Menelaus leaned forward, elbows on the table, the posture of a man three cups past propriety. "You've been quiet. Don't tell me Trojan princes have no opinions on trade routes."

The prince looked up. He had been staring at his hands, or at the table, or at nothing.

"Forgive me." His voice was rougher than she'd expected. Unpolished. "I'm still learning. The sea routes. The politics. All of it."

"Still learning?" Menelaus's eyebrows rose. "How old are you, boy?"

"Twenty-three. But I only came to court six months ago. Before that I was—" He stopped. Something flickered across his face. "Elsewhere."

Aeneas stepped in smoothly. "Prince Paris was raised in the countryside. A tradition in some noble Trojan families. Keeps the young princes humble, connected to the land."

"Humble." Menelaus snorted. "My brother Agamemnon could use some of that. Send him to live with shepherds for a few years, see if it sweetens his temper." More laughter. Menelaus drained his cup, held it out for a servant to refill. "Well, Prince Paris. You're at court now. What do you make of it?"

Paris was quiet for a moment. Then: "Loud."

Menelaus blinked. Then he roared with laughter, slapping the table hard enough to rattle the plates. "Loud! He says it's loud!" He wiped his eyes. "I like this one. Honest. Aeneas, why can't you be this honest?"

"Because honesty is a luxury for princes, my lord. Advisors must be diplomatic."

"Diplomatic. Another word for lying." Menelaus shook his head, still chuckling. "Helen. Helen, are you listening? The Trojan prince thinks court is loud."

Helen turned her head.

She meant to smile. To say something empty and appropriate—*how refreshing* or *he's not wrong* or any of the phrases she kept ready for moments like this.

Paris was looking at her.

Not at her gown or the gold in her hair. He was looking at her face, at her eyes, with an expression she didn't recognize. Not hunger. Not possession. Something almost like—

A servant stepped between them, refilling her cup. The wine was very red. It splashed against the sides of the cup, catching the torchlight.

"My lady?"

Helen realized she hadn't answered. Her husband was watching her now, his brow slightly creased. Aeneas was watching. The servants were watching. She had been silent too long.

"Forgive me." Her voice came out strange. She reached for her cup, and her hand knocked against the servant's wrist, and wine spilled across the white linen of the table.

"Oh—" She stood, too fast, her chair scraping back. "How clumsy. I'm sorry, I—"

"It's nothing." Menelaus was already waving servants forward, his attention on the spreading stain. "Just wine. Sit, sit."

Helen didn't sit. She stood with her hands at her sides, and she could not stop herself from looking across the table one more time.

Paris hadn't moved. He was still watching her. And now there was something else in his expression—confusion, wonder—as if he too had felt something pass between them and didn't understand what it was.

"My lady." Her handmaiden was at her elbow, voice low. "Are you unwell? You've gone pale."

"The heat. Just the heat."

She let herself be guided back to her seat. The stained linen was whisked away, replaced with fresh. Menelaus was telling a story about a hunting accident, and the men were laughing, and the feast continued.

Helen folded her hands in her lap. They were trembling.

She did not look at the Trojan prince again. She kept her eyes on the table, on the food she wasn't eating, on the cup she didn't dare lift for fear she'd spill it again.

But she could feel him watching her.

The feast lasted another two hours.

## CASSANDRA

Across the sea, Cassandra gasped and gripped the window frame so hard the stone cut her palms.

The vision came without warning—not the slow build of a dream but a door slamming open. She was in a great hall in a foreign palace. Torches and wine and roasted meat. A red stain spreading across white linen.

And her brother, sitting at a feast, looking at a woman.

The woman was golden. That was the only word for it. Golden hair, golden skin, a face that hurt to look at the way the goddesses had hurt. She was looking back at Paris with something broken open in her expression, something that had been locked away and was now spilling out like wine from a cup.

They were just looking at each other.

Nothing more. No touch, no word, no sin that anyone could name.

But Cassandra could see the thread spinning out between them. It glowed like the apple had glowed—gold and barbed, beautiful and deadly. It wrapped around her brother's throat, around the woman's wrists. It stretched across the sea to Troy and wound itself around the towers.

She watched the woman spill her wine. Watched her stand too fast, pale and shaking. Watched her sit back down and fold her trembling hands and refuse to look up again.

It didn't matter. The thread was already there. The thread didn't care about looking away.

"No," Cassandra whispered. "No, no, no—"

But the vision didn't stop. It never stopped. She watched the feast continue, watched her brother pretend to listen to conversations while his eyes kept drifting to the golden woman. Watched the woman's husband laugh and drink and notice nothing.

She watched the thread pull tighter.

The vision released her. She sagged against the window frame, breathing hard, her palms slick with blood where the stone had cut them.

Below, the city celebrated. Drums and lyres. Drunken singing. The return of the lost prince. The beginning of a golden age.

Cassandra looked at the blood on her hands. Looked at the city that was already burning, if you knew how to see it.

"And so it begins," she said to no one.

The celebration continued long into the night.
