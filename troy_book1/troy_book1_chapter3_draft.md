# Chapter Three: The Oath

---

The stone wall had stood for sixty years, and it would stand for sixty more if the mortar was mixed right.

Odysseus worked the trowel, scraping excess from the joints, checking the line by eye. His hands were rough with lime, his tunic stained with sweat. Beside him, old Eurylochus held the stones steady while Odysseus set them.

"Higher on the left," Odysseus said.

"You said lower a moment ago."

"I changed my mind. Higher."

Eurylochus grunted and shifted the stone. Odysseus checked the line again, nodded, and began packing mortar around the base.

Behind them, in the shade of an olive tree, Penelope sat with Telemachus in her lap. The baby was gumming a strip of leather, drooling contentedly. Penelope was mending a fishing net, her fingers quick and sure, glancing up occasionally to watch her husband work.

"You could hire men for this," she said.

"I could."

"You're the king."

"I'm aware." Odysseus stepped back, studied the wall. "But then I'd have to pay them, and I'd rather spend the silver on that breeding ram Philoctetes is selling."

"The spotted one?"

"The spotted one. His lambs fetch twice the price at market."

Penelope smiled.

Ithaca was not a wealthy kingdom. Rocky soil, steep hills, a harbor too small for serious trade. Other kings laughed at it—Odysseus had heard them, at feasts and councils, making jokes about the little island and its little king with his little ambitions.

Let them laugh. He had Penelope. He had Telemachus. He had olive trees and sheep and a stone wall that would stand for sixty years if the mortar was mixed right.

A servant appeared at the edge of the field, hesitating.

"My lord. A ship has arrived. From Mycenae. They say—"

"I know what they say."

Odysseus set down his trowel. Wiped his hands on his tunic. Looked at Penelope for a long moment.

Then he walked toward the harbor, and he didn't look back.

---

"She was stolen. By a prince of Troy."

Agamemnon set down his cup. Around the table, his family sat frozen—Clytemnestra with her hand on her wine, Iphigenia with a bite of bread halfway to her mouth, the younger children staring with wide eyes.

"Stolen?" Iphigenia swallowed her bread. "How do you steal a wife?"

"You take her." Agamemnon's voice was mild. "You put her on a ship. You sail away."

"But what about Uncle Menelaus? Didn't he try to stop them?"

"Your uncle was hunting. When he returned, she was gone." Agamemnon picked up his cup again, swirled the wine. "Along with most of his treasury."

Clytemnestra spoke for the first time. "And now?"

"Now the oath is invoked. Every man who swore to defend Helen's husband must answer the call." He drank. "I'll lead the expedition myself."

Silence. Iphigenia looked between her parents.

"How long will you be gone?" she asked.

"As long as it takes. A year. Perhaps two."

"Two years?"

"Troy is far. And strong. It won't fall easily."

Iphigenia's face was troubled.

"Father—will you be safe?"

Agamemnon smiled.

"I'll have the greatest army ever assembled. A thousand ships. Every king in Greece." He reached across the table, squeezed her hand. "I'll be perfectly safe."

Clytemnestra watched her husband. Her face revealed nothing.

"When do you leave?" she asked.

"Within the fortnight. The fleet gathers at Aulis." Agamemnon pushed back from the table. "I have messages to send. Letters to dictate."

He kissed Iphigenia on the forehead, nodded to Clytemnestra, and strode from the room.

Clytemnestra sat very still.

"Mother?" Iphigenia's voice was uncertain. "Is something wrong?"

"No." Clytemnestra rose, began clearing plates that the servants should have cleared. "Nothing's wrong. Finish your dinner."

She carried the plates to the sideboard. Her hands were steady.

Her eyes were not.

---

Cassandra woke gasping, clutching at sheets that weren't there.

Not a vision of Troy this time. Something else. Distant places, distant faces. Roads stretching across the Greek mainland, riders carrying messages. Harbors filling with ships. Men sharpening swords.

The word spreading like fire: *Helen. Troy. War.*

She went to the window. Troy slept below her, peaceful, unaware. The same streets. The same walls. The same stars overhead.

But something had shifted.

"They're coming," she whispered. "All of them."

The night didn't answer. It never did.

---

The messengers stood in a formal line, their Mycenaean armor polished, their faces carefully blank.

"The oath is invoked," the leader said. "All who swore are summoned to Aulis. Ships, men, and provisions for a year's campaign."

Odysseus nodded slowly. "How many have answered?"

"Every kingdom we've visited. Sparta, of course. Athens. Pylos. Argos." The messenger paused. "Phthia."

"Achilles."

"Prince Achilles has agreed to join the expedition. His father's Myrmidons will sail with the fleet."

Odysseus absorbed this.

"And the command?" Odysseus asked.

"Agamemnon leads. As high king."

"Of course he does."

The messenger's expression flickered—just for a moment—before smoothing back to blankness.

"You have a fortnight, my lord. We'll wait for your answer."

They withdrew, leaving Odysseus alone with Penelope. She had come in during the audience, Telemachus on her hip, and had stood silent in the corner.

Now she crossed to him.

"You knew this might happen," she said. "When you made them swear."

"I thought it would protect us. Mutual defense. Shared risk." He laughed, a bitter sound. "I was twenty-three. I thought I was the cleverest man in Greece."

"You were. You still are."

He looked at her. At Telemachus, drowsy in her arms.

"I'll think of something," he said.

---

Three days later, the messengers were still waiting.

Penelope met them at the door each morning, apologetic, worried. Her husband had taken ill. A fever. He raved through the nights, didn't recognize his own servants. The healer said it might be weeks before he recovered—if he recovered at all.

The messengers conferred. Most were ready to leave, to report to Agamemnon that Odysseus of Ithaca had been struck by madness, that his oath could not be enforced.

One of them was not convinced.

Palamedes was young—perhaps thirty, sharp-featured, with eyes that missed nothing.

"We'll wait," he said each morning. "A few more days."

On the fourth day, a servant reported that the king had risen from his sickbed. He'd wandered down to the beach. He was behaving strangely.

Palamedes smiled.

---

Cassandra pressed her palms against the cool stone of her window and let the vision take her.

A beach. Not Troy's beach—somewhere rockier, greyer. A man walked behind a plow, cutting furrows in the wet sand. He'd yoked a donkey and an ox together, mismatched, absurd. He was scattering something from a bag at his hip.

Salt. He was sowing salt into sand.

Other men watched from the dunes. Most looked uncomfortable, ready to leave.

One did not. A sharp-faced man, younger than the others, watching the plowman with cold patience.

The vision shifted. The sharp-faced man walking away from the beach. Toward a farmhouse. Toward a woman holding an infant.

He took the baby from her arms.

The vision fractured, broke apart. Cassandra gasped, her hands slipping on the stone.

She didn't understand what she'd seen. But she stayed at the window until dawn, watching the sea.

---

Agamemnon sat alone in his private chamber, a map of the Aegean spread before him.

Troy. He traced the coastline with his finger. The Hellespont, where the straits narrowed. The rich farmland of the Troad. The walls that had never fallen.

He'd wanted this for years. Not Helen—Helen was a pretext, a convenient outrage to unite the kings. What he wanted was Troy itself. The city that controlled the trade routes, that taxed every ship passing between the seas, that grew fat on wealth that should have been flowing to Greece.

What he wanted was to be the man who conquered it.

A knock at the door. Iphigenia's voice: "Father? May I come in?"

He rolled up the map. "Enter."

She slipped through the door, still in her sleeping shift, her hair loose around her shoulders. "I couldn't sleep."

"Nor could I."

She crossed to him, and he pulled her into an embrace—his eldest, his favorite, the one who looked most like Clytemnestra had looked when he'd married her. Before the distance had grown between them. Before they'd become strangers sharing a bed.

"I heard the servants talking," Iphigenia said. "About Achilles."

"What about him?"

"They say he's the handsomest man in Greece. That he fights like a god." She pulled back, looked up at him. "Will I meet him? When the war is over?"

Agamemnon studied his daughter's face. Fifteen. Marriageable. A king's daughter, a valuable alliance.

Achilles was young, celebrated, the son of a goddess. An alliance with Phthia would cement Agamemnon's position. Would make his house the most powerful in Greece.

"Perhaps," he said. "When this is over."

"Do you promise?"

He kissed her forehead. "I promise you'll meet him. Now go back to bed."

She smiled, bright and trusting, and slipped out the door.

Agamemnon sat in the darkness for a long time, thinking about Troy.

Thinking about wind, and ships, and the things men did to get what they wanted.

---

The beach was grey in the morning light.

Odysseus walked behind the plow, his hands steady on the handles, his eyes fixed on nothing. The donkey and ox strained against their mismatched yoke, pulling at different angles, the furrow wavering drunkenly across the sand.

He reached into the bag at his hip. Scattered salt into the furrow. Muttered words that made no sense—fragments of songs, names of people who didn't exist, numbers that added up to nothing.

On the dunes, the Mycenaean messengers watched.

"He's mad," one of them said. "Truly mad. We should go."

"Look at his hands," Palamedes said.

"What about them?"

"They're steady. A man raving with fever doesn't have steady hands."

The other messengers exchanged glances. They wanted to leave. They'd been here for days, sleeping in their ship, eating dried fish and stale bread. The king of Ithaca was clearly insane. What more was there to see?

Palamedes watched the plowman for another long moment. Then he turned and walked toward the farmhouse.

Odysseus saw him go.

His hands tightened on the plow. He kept walking, kept muttering, kept scattering salt into the sand.

Palamedes disappeared inside the farmhouse.

The ox snorted, jerked against the yoke. The furrow veered left. Odysseus corrected, his jaw tight.

Palamedes emerged from the farmhouse.

He was carrying something. A bundle, wrapped in cloth, squirming.

Penelope came running after him, her face white. "No—you can't—give him back—"

Palamedes walked past her without stopping. Walked down the beach. Walked directly into the plowed field.

And set the baby in the dirt, directly in the path of the plow.

Telemachus wailed. His small fists beat the air. He was six months old, too young to crawl away, too young to do anything but scream.

Odysseus kept walking.

The plow cut through the sand, steady, straight.

Penelope was screaming now. The other messengers were frozen on the dunes, uncertain.

The plow got closer.

Odysseus's eyes were vacant. His lips moved, forming nonsense words.

The blade was ten feet away.

Telemachus screamed.

Five feet.

The ox's hooves churned sand inches from the baby's head.

Three feet.

Odysseus swerved.

The plow carved a wild arc around his son. The ox bellowed in confusion. The donkey stumbled. The whole absurd contraption lurched to a halt.

Silence.

Palamedes smiled. "Your mind seems clear enough to me."

Odysseus stood very still. His hands were still on the plow handles. His eyes were on his son, crying in the sand, and on Palamedes standing over him.

"Pick him up," Odysseus said. His voice was quiet.

One of the other messengers scrambled down from the dunes, scooped up the baby. Penelope snatched Telemachus from his arms, clutching him to her chest, backing away with wild eyes.

Odysseus let go of the plow. He faced Palamedes across the ruined furrow.

"You put my son in front of a blade."

"I tested a suspicion. I was right." Palamedes shrugged. "The oath remembers, Odysseus. Even if you'd rather forget."

"You put my son in front of a blade."

"And you swerved. Because you're not mad. Because you were never mad." Palamedes turned to the other messengers. "We're done here. The king of Ithaca will be at Aulis in a fortnight."

He walked away. The others followed, glancing back nervously.

Odysseus stood in the furrow, salt on his hands, watching them go.

Penelope approached, Telemachus still crying against her shoulder. "Odysseus—"

"Start packing."

"What?"

"We have two weeks. I need to speak with the shipwright." He looked at her, and his eyes were flat, empty, cold. "I need to prepare twelve ships."

"Odysseus, your hands—"

He looked down. His hands were shaking. Not from fear. From something else.

"I want you to remember that man's name," he said. "Palamedes. Son of Nauplius. Prince of Euboea."

"Why?"

Odysseus watched the Mycenaean ship push off from the harbor, its sail catching the wind.

"Because one day I'm going to kill him."

He said it the way another man might say *it looks like rain* or *the olives are ripe*. A statement of fact. A thing that would happen.

Penelope held their son and said nothing.

---

The throne room was cold despite the braziers.

Cassandra stood before her father, her hands clasped to keep them from shaking. Priam sat on his throne, looking old and tired—his white beard unkempt, his spotted hands gripping the armrests, his shoulders curved forward as if the weight of the crown had finally become too heavy to bear. Beside him, Paris stood with his arm around Helen, still playing the young lovers, still pretending they hadn't doomed everyone in the room.

Hector was there too, arms crossed, face unreadable. He wouldn't meet her eyes.

"A thousand ships," Cassandra said. "That's what I've seen. A thousand ships and a hundred thousand men. They're gathering now, at a place called Aulis. Every king in Greece. Every warrior. The largest army the world has ever known."

Priam nodded slowly. "We've heard the reports. Traders have been bringing news for weeks."

"Then you know I'm not making this up. You know it's real."

"I know the Greeks are angry. I know they're making threats." Priam spread his hands. "But Troy has weathered threats before. Our walls have never fallen. Our allies are many. We'll negotiate, pay reparations if we must—"

"You can't negotiate with this." Cassandra stepped forward. "Father, listen to me. They're not coming for gold. They're not coming for Helen. They're coming because Agamemnon has wanted an excuse to destroy us for twenty years, and now he has one. They won't stop until Troy is ash."

Paris shifted uncomfortably. "Cassandra—"

"Don't." She turned on him, and he flinched from whatever he saw in her face. "Don't speak to me. Don't look at me. This is your doing. All of it. And you don't even have the grace to be ashamed."

"That's enough." Priam's voice was sharp. "Cassandra, I know you believe what you're saying. I know it feels real to you. But I cannot make decisions based on—"

"On what? On truth? On sight?" She laughed, a broken sound. "No. Of course not. That's never been how this works."

She turned and walked toward the door. Her legs were unsteady but she kept them moving.

"Cassandra." Hector's voice. She stopped but didn't turn. "I'm doubling the watch. Reinforcing the outer walls. Stockpiling grain for a siege."

"It won't be enough."

"Maybe not. But it's what I can do."

She stood there for a moment, her back to the room. Then she kept walking.

In the corridor outside, footsteps followed her. Light, quick. Not Hector.

"Cassandra. Wait."

She stopped. Turned.

Helen stood a few paces behind her, alone.

"You see things," Helen said. "Real things."

"Yes."

"And no one believes you."

Cassandra laughed. "Is that what you wanted to ask? Whether I'm really mad?"

"I know you're not mad." Helen took a step closer. "I saw your face in the throne room. That's not madness. That's—" She stopped, searching for the word. "Exhaustion. From knowing things you can't make anyone else understand."

Cassandra studied her.

"Why do you care?" Cassandra asked.

"Because I think we're the same. Both of us seeing things clearly in a world that refuses to look." Helen's voice was quiet. "I believe you. I don't know if that helps. But I do."

Cassandra was silent for a long moment.

"There's a girl," she said finally. "In one of the visions. I don't know who she is—young, fifteen or sixteen. Dark hair. She's wearing white, like a bride."

Helen frowned. "What about her?"

"She's going to die. Soon. Before the ships sail." Cassandra turned away. "The Greeks are going to kill one of their own. A sacrifice. I don't know why. I don't know what god they're trying to appease. But that girl is going to walk to an altar thinking she's getting married, and instead—"

She stopped. She couldn't say the rest.

"Cassandra—"

"Believing me won't help her. Nothing will help her." Cassandra started walking again. "Nothing ever helps."

She left Helen standing alone in the corridor, her hand half-raised, her face pale in the torchlight.

Cassandra made it to her chambers before her legs gave out.

She sat on the cold floor, her back against the door, and let the shaking come. The council. The faces. Paris's wounded expression, Priam's pitying eyes, Hector's careful silence.

This is the last time, she told herself. The last time I stand in that room. The last time I beg them to see what I see.

She had been doing this for years.

And now the thousand ships were gathering. The girl in white was walking toward her death. Troy was burning in every dream Cassandra had.

She could keep warning them. Could stand in that throne room day after day, speaking truths that slipped from their minds like water from oiled cloth. Could watch their eyes glaze over, watch the curse do its work, watch them turn away and make the same mistakes again and again.

Or she could stop.

The thought was quiet. Almost peaceful.

She could stop trying to change what couldn't be changed.

She could just... watch. Bear witness. Let the doom come, and remember it, and survive long enough to see how it ended.

It felt like giving up. It felt like relief.

Cassandra pulled her knees to her chest and sat in the darkness of her room, listening to the city sleep around her, and made her choice.

No more warnings. No more pleas. From now on, she would only watch.

The gods had made her a prophet. Fine.

But she would not beg anymore.

---

Aulis was chaos.

Ships crowded the harbor, packed so tightly that a man could walk from one end to the other stepping only on decks. Tents covered the hills above the beach, thousands of them. The air smelled of smoke and sweat and horses.

Agamemnon stood on a rise overlooking the fleet, and he smiled.

"How many?" he asked.

"The count is still coming in." His aide consulted a wax tablet. "But we believe over a thousand ships. Perhaps ninety thousand men."

"Ninety thousand."

"The largest army ever assembled. By far."

Agamemnon looked out at the ships. His army. His war.

"And the kings?"

"All present, my lord. Nestor of Pylos arrived this morning. Diomedes of Argos yesterday. Ajax—both of them—the day before."

"Odysseus?"

"Arrived last night. Twelve ships from Ithaca. He's camped on the north shore."

Agamemnon nodded.

"Call a council," he said. "All the kings. Tomorrow at dawn."

"Yes, my lord."

The aide hurried away. Agamemnon stayed on the rise, watching his army prepare for war.

---

Odysseus found his camp on the north shore, as far from the main encampment as he could manage. His Ithacans were already setting up tents, digging latrines, establishing the routines of military life.

He walked among them, speaking to each man by name, checking their equipment, asking about their families. These were his people—farmers and fishermen, most of them, men who'd never held a sword in anger. They trusted him to bring them home.

He wondered how many of them would see Ithaca again.

At the edge of the camp, overlooking the bay, he stopped. The fleet stretched before him, impossible in its scale. He tried to count the ships and gave up.

A thousand kings had come to fight over one woman.

Footsteps behind him. He turned.

Palamedes stood a few paces away, silhouetted against the setting sun.

Odysseus noted Palamedes's position in the camp.

"Odysseus." His voice was pleasant, conversational. "Settling in?"

"Yes."

"Good. The council meets tomorrow. Agamemnon will want to hear from all the kings." Palamedes smiled. "I'm sure you'll have valuable insights. You usually do."

Odysseus said nothing.

"No hard feelings, I hope. About Ithaca. I was just doing my duty."

"Of course."

"The oath is sacred. Surely you understand that better than anyone."

"I do."

Palamedes waited, perhaps expecting more. When nothing came, he shrugged.

"Well. I'll see you at the council."

He walked away, picking his way through the tents toward the main camp.

Odysseus watched him go. His face was blank. His eyes were not.

---

The council tent was vast, large enough to hold a hundred men and their attendants. The kings of Greece filled it—some seated, some standing, all armed, all watching each other with the careful wariness of wolves sharing a kill.

Agamemnon took the central position. He wore no crown, carried no scepter. He didn't need to. Every eye was already on him.

"My lords." His voice carried easily, filling the tent. "We all know why we're here. We all know what was taken from us."

He paused, letting the silence build.

"A prince of Troy came to Greece as a guest. He ate at our tables. He drank our wine. He accepted our hospitality. And then he stole the queen of Sparta from her husband's bed and the gold from her husband's treasury."

Murmurs around the tent. Odysseus watched the faces.

"If we let this stand," Agamemnon continued, "we invite every barbarian prince in the world to do the same. If Paris of Troy can steal a Greek queen and face no consequence, none of our wives are safe. None of our thrones are secure."

He let that sink in.

"This is not about Helen. This is not about Menelaus. This is about whether Greece will be ruled by Greeks or by anyone with a fast ship and a sharp sword."

Better, Odysseus thought. He was good, Agamemnon. You could almost believe he meant it.

"The war will not be easy. Troy is strong. Her walls have never fallen. But we are stronger. A thousand ships. A hundred thousand men. The greatest army the world has ever seen." Agamemnon spread his arms. "We will sail to Troy. We will batter down her gates. We will take back what was stolen and burn the city that dared to steal it. And when we return, we will return as conquerors—the men who taught the world that Greece is not to be trifled with."

Cheers, scattered at first, then building. The kings pounded their spear-butts on the ground. Even the skeptical ones were nodding, caught up in the vision.

Odysseus did not cheer. He watched Agamemnon's face, saw the satisfaction there, the calculation.

This man would do anything to win this war. Anything at all.

It was not a comforting thought.

---

The wind died three days later.

At first, no one thought much of it. The weather was changeable on this coast; calms came and went. The men used the time to drill, to repair equipment, to drink and gamble and fight.

But the calm persisted. Day after day, the sea lay flat as glass. The sails hung limp. The ships couldn't move.

A week passed. Then two. Food stores began to dwindle. Men grew restless, then angry. Fights broke out in the camps. A Locrian killed a Thessalian over a dice game; the dead man's companions demanded blood price; both armies nearly came to blows before Agamemnon intervened.

The kings began to mutter. They had crops to harvest, kingdoms to govern. They couldn't sit on this beach forever, waiting for wind that wouldn't come.

Agamemnon summoned the priests.

---

Calchas was old, his beard white, his eyes milky with cataracts. But his voice was clear, and when he spoke, men listened.

"The goddess Artemis is angry," he said. "A sacred grove was violated. A deer was killed at her spring, during the hunt for which she had not given permission."

Agamemnon stood very still. "What hunt?"

"At Sparta, my lord. A royal hunt. The hunters trespassed on holy ground. Killed a deer that was sacred to the goddess." Calchas paused. "The goddess demands payment."

"What payment?"

"A life for a life. Royal blood on her altar." The old priest's voice didn't waver. "Your daughter, my lord. Iphigenia. Nothing else will suffice."

The tent was silent. The other kings stared. Menelaus's face was ashen.

Agamemnon didn't move. His expression betrayed nothing.

"You're certain," he said.

"The signs are clear. Until the goddess is appeased, the wind will not blow. The fleet will not sail. The war will not begin."

"And there's no other way."

"None, my lord."

Agamemnon turned away. Walked to the entrance of the tent. Looked out at the still harbor, the thousand ships, the army waiting for wind that would not come.

He thought of Iphigenia helping him pack. *Will you introduce me to Achilles?*

He thought of Clytemnestra's eyes.

He thought of Troy.

"Tell no one," he said, without turning. "I need to think."

"My lord—"

"Tell *no one*. That's an order."

Calchas bowed, his old bones creaking, and withdrew.

Agamemnon stood alone at the entrance of the tent. Behind him, the largest army in history waited for a war that could not begin.

Before him, the sea stretched flat and silver.

*End of Chapter Three*
