## ODYSSEUS

The argument had been going on for an hour.

Odysseus sat at the back of the council tent, watching the kings shout at each other.

"—three weeks late! Three weeks! My men are eating half-rations, and you're telling me to be patient?"

"The storms—"

"There are always storms! There are always excuses! Meanwhile, my soldiers are starting to look at the horses like they're wondering how they'd taste!"

Agamemnon raised his hand. The shouting subsided, grudgingly.

He turned to his quartermaster. "Numbers. How many days of grain? How many cattle?"

The quartermaster consulted his tablets. "Twelve days at current rations, my lord. Maybe fifteen if we cut further. The cattle—"

"Twelve days." Agamemnon swept a cup from the table. It clattered across the floor. "Twelve days. After five years of siege."

Silence.

"The supply ships will arrive when they arrive. Until then, we make do. Cut rations for the auxiliary troops—the allies can feed their own men. Find more. Raid further inland if you have to."

"Make do with what?" someone muttered. "Air? Sand?"

Odysseus studied Agamemnon while the others argued. The high king had aged badly in the five years since Aulis—his hair more grey than gold now, his face heavier, his patience worn thin.

Achilles's seat was empty. It usually was, these days.

"Where's the son of Peleus?" someone muttered. "Too good to sit through supply meetings?"

"He's training," Patroclus said from his place near the wall. "As he does every morning."

"Training for what? We haven't had a real battle in months."

"Perhaps that's why he trains. To stay ready."

The argument circled back to grain, to ships, to the endless logistics of keeping a hundred thousand men fed and armed and pointed at walls that never fell. Odysseus let it wash over him. He'd heard it all before. He'd been hearing it for five years.

When the shouting reached its peak, he stood.

"There's another option."

The tent went quiet.

"The coastal villages to the south. Trojan allies. They've been supplying the city for years—grain, livestock, timber. We've left them alone because raiding villages isn't honorable." He let the word hang in the air. "But neither is starving."

Silence.

"You're suggesting we attack civilians," someone said.

"I'm suggesting we attack enemy supply lines. The fact that they're defended by farmers instead of soldiers doesn't change the strategic calculation."

Silence.

"It's not... proper," Nestor said slowly. The old king of Pylos, ancient even when this war began, now so frail he had to be carried to councils. "War should be between warriors."

"War should be over by now," Odysseus replied. "It's not. We adapt or we starve. Those are the choices."

Agamemnon nodded slowly. "Achilles. He's been asking for action. Give him a dozen ships and a week. Let him remind the Trojans that their walls don't protect everyone."

"The village on the southern road," Agamemnon continued. "It's the closest. The easiest target."

The tent flap opened. Achilles entered, still wearing his training leathers, sweat on his brow. He'd heard.

"Not the village." His voice cut through the murmuring. "The supply depot. Thebe, on the coast."

Agamemnon's jaw tightened. "Thebe has walls. The village is—"

"The village is farmers." Achilles moved to the table, looked at the map. "Thebe supplies half the grain that reaches Troy. Take it, and the siege tightens. Burn a village, and you've fed us for a week." He looked up at Agamemnon. "The depot."

Silence.

Agamemnon's face reddened, but before he could speak, Odysseus cut in: "The village first. It's closer, less defended. We need supplies now, not in a month."

Achilles held Agamemnon's gaze a moment longer. Then he turned and walked out.

The decision was made. The council dissolved into smaller arguments—who would go, how many ships, which villages to target. Odysseus slipped out while the others were still talking.

Agamemnon remained seated as the tent emptied.

When the last of them had gone, he reached into his robe and withdrew a pale blue ribbon, worn soft from years of handling. He didn't look at it often—months would pass, sometimes, before he remembered it was there. But moments like this, when the walls still stood and the years stretched on and the war demanded more than anyone had imagined, his hand would find it. A reflex. A habit he couldn't quite extinguish.

Iphigenia had given it to him when she was small. A good-luck charm, she'd called it. He'd kept it ever since.

Five years. Five years since the altar, since the knife, since the wind came. Five years since he'd proven what he was willing to pay. And here he sat, grey and tired, the walls still standing, the war nowhere near its end.

He thought: *It should have been enough.*

He thought: *It should have bought more than this.*

The ribbon was faded now, the blue gone pale. He ran his thumb across it once, feeling the softness of the fabric, and then he tucked it away again.

If he had to make the choice again—today, now, knowing what it would cost—would he?

The question surfaced sometimes, late at night, in the silence between one crisis and the next. He examined it the way he examined all threats: coldly, carefully, without sentiment.

Yes. He would do it again. The war still needed winning. The walls still needed falling. And he was still the man who could do what must be done.

That was the worst part. Not that the choice haunted him—but that it didn't. He'd paid with his daughter's life, and he'd do it again, and the only thing he felt was tired.

He rose from the table and went to find his captains. There were raids to plan, supplies to manage, a siege to maintain.

The war went on.

The morning sun hit him as he stepped outside. Five years of Trojan summers, and he still wasn't used to the heat.

He walked the camp without destination, letting his feet carry him through the maze of tents and cook fires and latrines. The camp had grown permanent over the years—wooden structures replacing canvas, roads worn into the sand, a whole city built for the purpose of destroying another city.

A group of soldiers sat in the shade of a supply wagon, gambling with knucklebones. Odysseus paused to watch.

"...five winters now since I seen my boy. He was walking when I left. Now his mother writes he's asking questions about me. Wants to know when I'm coming home."

"What do you tell him?"

"What can I tell him? I don't know when I'm coming home. I don't know if I'm coming home."

Odysseus walked on.

Near the edge of the camp, a funeral pyre was burning. Not a warrior's pyre—this was smaller, sadder. A sickness had swept through the Argive tents last month. Thirty men dead, more still recovering. The healers called it camp fever. The soldiers called it Troy's revenge.

He found Achilles at the Myrmidon encampment, preparing for the raid. His men were loading ships—weapons, armor, empty sacks for grain.

"You heard," Achilles said without turning.

"I suggested it."

"Did you." Achilles turned now. He looked different than he had that first day on the beach—leaner, harder. "Getting your hands dirty for once."

"We all have dirty hands by now."

Achilles almost smiled. "True enough." He went back to inspecting a coil of rope. "I'll take twelve ships. Hit the villages at night. Be back before they can organize a response."

"It's not glory."

"No. It's theft." Achilles tossed the rope to a waiting soldier. "But it's movement. I've been sitting on this beach for five years, Odysseus. Watching those walls. Waiting for something to happen. Do you know what that's like?"

"I know exactly what it's like."

"Then you know I'll take anything. Raid villages, steal grain, burn farms—I don't care. As long as I'm doing something."

Odysseus watched him for a moment.

"The walls will fall," Odysseus said. "Eventually."

"Eventually." Achilles's voice was flat. "You've been saying that for five years. Eventually. Someday. When the time is right." He looked at the distant walls, pale and solid in the morning light. "How many men die waiting for eventually? How many more years do we sit here, growing old, while those walls just... stand?"

Odysseus had no answer. He'd asked himself the same question a thousand times.

"Do what you need to do," he said. "Bring back the grain. We'll figure out the rest."

Achilles nodded. Already turning away, already focused on the raid.

Odysseus walked back toward the main camp, the sun beating down on his shoulders, the walls of Troy shimmering in the heat.

## HELEN

Helen woke before Paris did.

She lay still, watching him sleep. His face was softer in the grey light—younger, almost peaceful. His hand rested on her hip, warm and familiar.

Five years. Five years of this room, this bed, this man. Five years of the world shrinking to the space between these walls.

She slid out from under his hand. He stirred, reached for her.

"Stay."

"I can't."

"The healing house can survive—"

"I know." She was already dressing, her movements quick and practiced. "I'll be back tonight."

He watched her from the bed. She could feel his eyes on her back, feel the question he didn't ask anymore.

At the door, she paused. Looked back.

He was still watching. That same look he'd had for months now—patient, waiting, slightly puzzled. As if he couldn't quite understand why she kept leaving.

She didn't know how to explain it. The need to be somewhere, do something, feel something other than the weight of these walls.

"Tonight," she said.

He nodded. She left.

---

Before the healing house, there was the other work.

Helen descended the servant stairs, a bundle of cloth in her arms—bandages she'd cut from her own linens. The palace was quiet; the servants wouldn't stir for another hour.

The refugee quarters were in the lower city, near the walls. Cramped rooms, too many people, the smell of unwashed bodies and despair. Helen moved through the narrow streets, her hood pulled low.

A woman recognized her. Started to bow.

Helen pressed the cloth into her hands. "Don't tell anyone."

She was gone before the woman could respond.

---

The healing house had been a temple once, before the war. Now the statues were pushed against the walls, the altar covered with bandages and herb pouches, the sacred space given over to the broken and the dying.

Helen moved through the rows of pallets, changing bandages, checking wounds, doing the hundred small tasks she'd learned over five years. The Trojan healers had resisted her at first—what did a Spartan queen know about medicine?—but she'd learned. She'd watched, and helped, and eventually they'd accepted her presence if not her history.

A soldier grabbed her wrist as she passed. Young, maybe twenty, his face flushed with fever.

"You're her," he said. "Helen."

"Yes."

"My brother. He was at the landing. First day." His grip tightened. "Seventeen years old. He didn't even make it off the beach."

Helen didn't pull away. She didn't flinch. She had learned not to flinch. "I'm sorry."

"Are you? Are you really?"

"Yes." She kept her voice steady. "I'm sorry for your brother. I'm sorry for all of them."

The soldier stared at her.

Finally, his grip loosened. He turned away, toward the wall.

Helen finished his bandage and moved to the next patient.

Later, outside, she sat against the temple wall and let herself breathe. The sun was high now, the streets empty—everyone who could be inside was inside, escaping the heat.

Footsteps. She looked up.

A woman, older, well-dressed. One of the noble families who had lost sons in the fighting. Helen recognized her but didn't know her name.

"The healers say you're useful," the woman said. "They say you work hard. That you don't complain."

Helen waited.

"All the bandages in the world won't bring back my son."

"No."

The woman seemed to expect more. Helen had nothing more to give. She'd said the words so many times they'd worn smooth, meaningless.

"My daughter works here," the woman said finally. "She says you're kind to the soldiers."

"I try."

The woman studied her a moment longer. Whatever she was looking for, she didn't find it. She walked away.

Helen stayed against the wall. Her hands were rough now, callused.

---

## CASSANDRA

The tower was hot and close, but Cassandra didn't seem to notice.

She sat by the window, staring at nothing, her hands folded in her lap. She'd lost weight again—Helen could see it in the sharpness of her cheekbones, the way her dress hung loose on her frame.

"I brought food," Helen said. She set the tray on the table: bread, cheese, figs, a cup of watered wine. "The bread is fresh. I made sure."

Cassandra didn't respond.

Helen sat down across from her. This was their ritual now, almost every evening—Helen bringing food, sitting with her, talking about nothing. Sometimes Cassandra responded. Sometimes she didn't. Either way, Helen came.

"There was a boy today," Helen said. "At the healing house. He couldn't have been more than fifteen. Arrow wound in his shoulder—he'll live, but it'll scar badly. He kept asking for his mother."

Cassandra's eyes moved, slowly, focusing on something Helen couldn't see.

"The ships are coming back," she murmured. "But they're not the same ships."

"What ships?"

"He buries the wrong body. He doesn't know." Cassandra's voice was dreamy, distant. "He thinks it's the right one, but it isn't. He'll find out later. When it's too late."

Helen didn't ask what it meant. She'd learned not to. The visions came and went, fragments of things that hadn't happened yet, and asking only seemed to make Cassandra retreat further.

"Eat something," she said instead.

Cassandra looked at the food. Reached out, slowly, and picked up a piece of bread. She held it but didn't eat.

"You're the only one who comes," she said. Her voice was clearer now, almost normal. "Do you know that? Everyone else is afraid of me. My parents, my brothers—they visit sometimes, but they're afraid. They look at me like I'm a disease they might catch."

"I'm not afraid."

"No." Cassandra almost smiled. "You're afraid of yourself. That's different."

Helen had no answer to that.

"We're the same," Cassandra continued. "Both of us cursed. Both of us trapped. Both of us waiting for something terrible that we can't stop."

She looked at Helen then—really looked, her eyes focusing with unusual clarity.

"What are we waiting for?"

Cassandra's eyes drifted back to the window. Back to whatever she saw there.

"The horse is getting closer," she whispered. "I can hear the teeth."

"Cassandra—"

But Cassandra was gone again, retreating into whatever place she went when the visions took her. Her hand was still holding the bread, but she'd forgotten it was there.

Helen stayed until the sun went down. Then she kissed Cassandra's forehead, left the food on the table, and walked back through the darkening streets to the room where Paris was waiting.

## ODYSSEUS

The lamp guttered as Odysseus dipped his stylus.

He sat alone in his tent, a wax tablet before him. Correspondence to copy—requests for supplies, reports to Agamemnon, the endless documentation of siege. Scribes handled most of it, but Odysseus liked to keep his hand in. A king should know how to write his own letters.

He formed the words carefully, matching the style of the original. Then he tried a different hand—rounder, more formal. The kind a palace scribe might use. Then another, cramped and hurried. He studied each result, smoothed the wax, tried again.

An hour passed. Two. The lamp burned low.

He set the tablet aside and went to walk the perimeter.

---

The camp was quiet.

Odysseus walked the circuit of the fortifications, checking sentries, looking for weaknesses. A habit he'd developed years ago.

Palamedes.

The man was walking the same circuit, from the opposite direction. They met at the northeast corner of the camp, where the fortifications overlooked the beach.

"Odysseus."

"Palamedes."

Neither moved. The moon was bright enough to see by.

"Couldn't sleep?" Palamedes asked.

"Something like that."

"I've been reviewing the supply records. The numbers from the last few raids don't quite match the distributions."

Odysseus's hand moved to the pouch at his belt. His fingers traced the shape of something inside.

"Discrepancies happen. War is messy."

"I'm sure that's all it is." Palamedes smiled. "I'll sort it out. I'm good with numbers."

Odysseus smiled back. The smile didn't reach his eyes.

"I know you are."

They stood in silence. Below them, the waves lapped at the sand.

"We could end this faster," Palamedes said. "If we worked together. You and I—we see things the others don't. We could coordinate, plan, make this siege actually work."

"Yes. We could."

"But you won't."

Odysseus looked at him. The sharp face had grown sharper over five years—leaner, weathered, the boyish confidence hardened into something else. But the eyes were the same. The same eyes that had watched Odysseus swerve around his son on the beach at Ithaca.

"No," he said. "I won't."

Palamedes nodded slowly. "Ithaca. You haven't forgotten."

"I'll never forget."

"I was doing my duty. The oath—"

"I know what you were doing."

Palamedes studied him. "I think I knew. Even then, when I put your son in the furrow. I knew you'd never let it go." He turned to walk away, then paused. "Those supply discrepancies. I'm sure they're nothing. But I'll keep looking."

"I'm sure you will."

Palamedes disappeared into the darkness.

Odysseus stayed at the corner of the fortifications, looking out at the sea. He felt again at the pouch on his belt. The waves kept their rhythm. The stars turned overhead.

He resumed his circuit, checking the sentries, counting the hours until dawn.

## HECTOR

The horns woke Hector from a dream of peace.

He was on his feet before he was fully conscious, reaching for his sword, his armor. Andromache was sitting up in bed, her eyes wide.

"What is it?"

"I don't know. Stay here."

He ran through the palace, past servants and guards who pressed against the walls to let him pass. The horns kept sounding—three long, two short, repeating. Not the rapid pulse of a direct assault. The signal for allied territory under attack.

He reached the walls. His captains were already there, pointing south.

Smoke. Orange light on the horizon.

"What's happening?"

"A raid, my lord. The Greeks hit one of the outer villages. The farms along the southern road."

"How many?"

"Reports say a dozen ships. Flying the Myrmidon banner."

Achilles.

Hector gripped the parapet, staring at the distant glow. The village was too far to reach in time—by the time they organized a sortie, the Greeks would be gone. But maybe, if they moved fast—

"Ready the cavalry. Two hundred men. We'll try to intercept them before they reach their ships."

"My lord, by the time we—"

"I know. Do it anyway."

---

## PARIS

Paris was on the walls when Hector found him.

He had his bow. His fingers were on the string.

Below, in the darkness beyond the walls, Greek scouts moved at the edge of torchlight. One of them—an officer, by his bearing—was directing the others. Three hundred yards, maybe more. A difficult shot. Not impossible.

Paris drew.

Hector's hand closed on his wrist. "Not him. Not yet."

"I could make it. From here, with the wind—"

"And then what? You kill one scout, and they know we have archers who can hit at three hundred yards. They stay beyond range. We lose the advantage." Hector's grip tightened. "Save it. For when it matters."

Paris lowered the bow. Watched the officer ride away.

"I could have made it," he said.

"I know." Hector was already moving toward the stairs. "That's why you didn't take it."

Paris stayed on the walls. A crow landed on the far parapet—sixty yards, maybe seventy. Without thinking, he drew and released in one motion.

The crow dropped.

A soldier nearby stared at him. Paris retrieved his arrow.

---

## HECTOR

They rode through the darkness, pushing the horses as hard as they dared.

The night was warm, the road familiar. Hector had ridden this way a hundred times—to inspect the outer defenses, to reassure the farmers that Troy would protect them. That the walls kept everyone safe.

The walls hadn't kept them safe. Nothing had.

They smelled the village before they saw it. Smoke and something worse.

They crested a rise, and the village spread out below them.

It was gone.

Not damaged. Not raided. Gone. The houses were burning, the grain stores collapsed, the livestock pens torn open and empty. Bodies in the street—some villagers, some Greeks who hadn't made it back to the ships. The fires were starting to die now, having consumed everything they could reach.

"Spread out," Hector said. His voice sounded strange in his own ears. "Search for survivors. Bring anyone you find."

His men moved into the ruins. Hector dismounted, walked through the destruction.

A house, still smoldering. The door was open—broken in, from the look of it. Inside, shapes that had been furniture, that had been belongings, that had been a life.

A shape that had been a person.

He moved on.

Another house. This one hadn't burned completely—the walls were standing, the roof half-collapsed. He stepped through the doorway.

The smell hit him first. Blood and smoke and something else, something he didn't want to name.

There were two of them. A woman, lying near the door—she'd been trying to run, maybe. And near the back of the house, almost hidden by fallen beams—

A child.

A girl, five or six years old. She was curled on her side, her arms wrapped around something. Hector moved closer, knelt beside her.

A toy. A wooden horse, crudely carved, the paint worn from handling.

Hector knelt in the ashes and looked at her.

"My lord."

He looked up. A captain, silhouetted in the doorway.

"The Greeks are gone. We found tracks leading to the shore—they've already sailed. We have some survivors. Maybe thirty."

"Out of how many?"

The captain hesitated. "The village had two hundred people, my lord. Maybe more."

Hector looked back at the girl.

"Gather the dead," he said. "All of them. We'll bring them back to Troy for proper burial."

"My lord, that's—there are dozens of bodies. Maybe a hundred. The horses can't—"

"Find wagons. Find carts. Carry them if you have to." He stood, and his knees ached from kneeling. When had that started? "They were our people. They died because we couldn't protect them. The least we can do is bury them properly."

The captain nodded and left.

Hector bent down and picked up the girl. She weighed almost nothing.

---

They reached the gates at dawn.

Word had spread. The streets were lined with people—silent, watching. Some were crying. Some just stared, their faces blank with shock.

On the palace steps, Priam stood waiting. He had come down himself, bareheaded, his white hair disheveled by the morning wind.

Hector rode at the head of the column. Behind him, wagons carried the dead. Behind that, the survivors walked—thirty people, mostly women and children, their eyes empty.

He was still holding the girl.

He'd carried her all the way from the village. His arms ached, his back screamed, but he couldn't put her down.

Polydamas appeared at his side. "My lord, the captains are asking—"

"Double the watch on the Scaean road." Hector didn't look at him. "Send scouts to track their raiding patterns. Where they go, how many, what they take. I want reports every three days."

"Yes, my lord."

Hector looked back at the gates where the survivors were still filing through. "And find room for them. Real room. Not the stables."

Polydamas nodded and was gone.

Andromache was waiting at the palace gates. Her face went white when she saw what he was carrying.

"Hector—"

"Our son." His voice cracked. "Where is he?"

"Asleep. In the nursery. Hector, what happened?"

"I need to see him. Now."

She led him through the palace, past servants who shrank against the walls, past guards who looked away. Into the nursery, where Astyanax lay sleeping in his bed.

Their son. Five years old now—born in the first months of the siege, knowing no world but this one. He had Andromache's eyes, Hector's jaw, a face that changed every day into something new. He was sucking his thumb, the way he always did when he slept deeply.

Hector stood in the doorway, the dead girl in his arms, looking at his living son.

"Hector." Andromache's voice was gentle. "You need to put her down."

He didn't move.

"Hector."

"This is what it is," he said. His voice was strange—flat, distant. "This is what it's going to be. For years. For however long this lasts. Children dying. Homes burning. And nothing I do will stop it."

"The walls—"

"The walls keep them out of the city. They don't keep anyone safe." He finally looked at her. "I thought I understood. When the fleet came. I thought I knew what war was. What it meant. I didn't know anything."

Andromache took the girl from his arms. Gently, carefully, as if she might still feel pain.

The child weighed almost nothing. Dark hair, matted with ash.

Andromache looked at the bed where Astyanax slept, his small chest rising and falling, his fist curled against his cheek. Then she looked at the girl in her arms. The same size. The same age, perhaps.

"We'll find her family," she said. Her voice was steady. She made it steady. "If they survived. If not—"

"Bury her properly. With the others."

"I will."

He looked at his son one more time. Still sleeping. Still peaceful. Still innocent of everything happening outside these walls.

"I need to go," he said. "There are reports to file. Defenses to check. Plans to make."

"You need to sleep."

"I can't."

"Hector—"

"I can't." He turned away from the nursery, from his son, from the dead girl his wife was holding. "There's always more war. There's always more to do."

He walked away, his footsteps echoing in the empty hall.

Andromache stood in the doorway of her son's room, holding someone else's daughter, watching her husband disappear into the palace. The dead child's weight was nothing. Her son's sleeping breath was everything.

She looked at Astyanax one last time. Then she went to find the servants. There were bodies to bury.

---

## ODYSSEUS

The raiders returned at midday.

Odysseus watched the ships come in, riding low in the water. Sacks of grain stacked on the decks. Goats bleating in makeshift pens.

"Oil!" A Myrmidon held up an amphora as the gangplank dropped. "They had a whole storehouse. Pressed last autumn—the good stuff."

"No more pig fat!" someone shouted from the crowd. Laughter. Whistling. Men clapped each other on the back.

The men unloaded quickly, joking among themselves, pleased with their success. The captives came last—mostly women, stumbling down the gangplanks, their faces blank. They would be distributed among the kings, as was custom. Property, now. The spoils of war.

Odysseus found Achilles standing apart from the celebration.

"Good raid?"

"Successful." Achilles's voice was flat.

"That's not what I asked."

Achilles didn't answer. He was watching one of the captive women—young, dark-haired, pretty in a common way. She was looking around at the camp, at the ships, at everything except the men who surrounded her.

"They didn't fight back," Achilles said finally. "Most of them. They saw us coming and they ran, or they hid, or they just... stood there. Waiting."

"They're farmers. Fishermen. They've never held a sword."

"I know. That's the point." Achilles turned to face him. "We came here to fight warriors. To test myself against the best Troy had. To earn glory." He laughed, a bitter sound. "And instead I'm butchering farmers and burning grain stores and—"

"There was a boy," he said. "Running. He had a fishing spear—a toy, really. Couldn't have hurt anyone with it." Achilles's jaw tightened. "I told myself it was necessary. That we needed the supplies. That this is what war requires."

"I made Patroclus promise something once," he said quietly. "Before we sailed. That if I ever became like Agamemnon—if I ever started calling slaughter necessary—he'd kill me himself."

Odysseus said nothing.

"I'm starting to understand why I asked him for that."

"The walls will fall," Odysseus said. Because it was what he always said. Because there was nothing else to say.

"You keep telling me that. Someday. Eventually." Achilles started walking toward the Myrmidon camp. "I'm starting to wonder if you actually believe it."

Patroclus was waiting at the edge of the camp. He fell into step beside Achilles, their heads close together, speaking in voices too low for Odysseus to hear.

Odysseus watched them go. Then he went to oversee the distribution of supplies.

---

## HELEN

Helen heard the news before she saw the wagons.

Voices in the street, spreading the word: a village had been raided. The dead were being brought back for burial. Hundreds of them.

She went to the walls.

From the battlements, she could see the column approaching.

The first wagon held the largest bodies. Men, she thought, though the shapes were wrong—limbs bent at angles that limbs shouldn't bend, torsos blackened and split where the fire had found them. Cloth covered most of them, but the cloth was soaked through with something dark, and flies had already found the gaps.

Behind the wagons, the survivors walked. A woman carried an infant that wasn't moving, pressed against her chest, her mouth opening and closing without sound. An old man limped on a leg that ended at the knee, the stump wrapped in someone's torn cloak. A boy—eight, maybe nine—walked alone, barefoot, his tunic stiff with dried blood.

At the head of the column, Hector. Carrying something.

A child.

Helen watched him pass through the gates, watched the silent crowd part around him, watched him carry the dead girl into the palace.

Around her, the other watchers were weeping. Somewhere a woman wailed—a sound that would go on for hours, for days.

Helen's eyes were dry.

She stayed on the walls until the smoke faded, watching the Greek camp, watching the sea.

---

## PARIS

That night, Paris found Helen on the balcony.

She was watching the funeral pyres, her arms wrapped around herself. He stood in the doorway for a long moment before she spoke.

"I saw Hector carry the girl in. She was maybe five."

Paris moved to stand beside her. The pyres cast orange light across the rooftops.

"I tried going to the healing house today," he said. "To help."

She looked at him.

"A man spit at me." He shrugged. "I left."

They watched the fires in silence. Once, he would have reached for her hand. Once, she would have leaned into him. Now they stood a foot apart, close enough to touch, not touching.

"I keep thinking about the bow," Paris said finally. "It's the one thing I'm good at. The one thing that might actually matter."

"Then use it."

"Hector won't let me near the walls."

"Hector isn't always right."

He reached for her, and brought her back inside. She let him. But when it was over, she turned away, and he lay staring at the ceiling, and neither of them slept.

---

## HECTOR

Hector found Andromache in their chambers.

He'd been walking the walls for hours—checking defenses, speaking with captains, doing all the things a commander was supposed to do. Now it was late, and he was tired, and he didn't know where else to go.

She was directing two servants with grain sacks when he entered. "The north quarter first—the Lyrnessus refugees have children. Then the temple stores." She saw Hector, kept talking: "And find Melanthios. His wife is sick. She needs a healer, not prayers."

The servants left. Only then did she turn to him.

"The girl," he said. "Did you find her family?"

"Her mother was among the dead. Her father is missing—maybe escaped, maybe taken." Andromache set down the wine. "She had a grandmother in the city. Old. Frail. But alive."

"Did you tell her?"

"Yes."

"How did she take it?"

"How do you think?"

Hector crossed to the window, stood beside her. Looking out at the city, at the distant glow of funeral pyres.

"How long can this go on?" he asked.

"As long as it has to."

"Years. Cassandra said—" He stopped.

"Said what?"

"Children not yet born will pick up swords. That's what she said. I don't know what it means, but—" He shook his head. "If she's right, this war will last longer than anyone imagines."

"Cassandra says many things." Andromache's voice was careful. "Not all prophecies come to pass."

"What if she's right about this? What if this goes on for ten years? Twenty? What if our son grows up in this siege, never knowing anything but war?"

Andromache was quiet for a moment. Then she stood, took his face in her hands.

"Then we protect him. We do what we can. We teach him to be strong, and smart, and good. And we survive."

"And if surviving means watching more villages burn? More children die?"

"Then we watch. And we remember. And we make them pay for every single one."

"I love you," he said.

"I know." She kissed him. "I love you too. Now sleep."

He let her lead him to bed. Let her wrap her arms around him. Let himself, for a moment, believe that these walls could protect the people he loved.

Outside, the funeral pyres burned down to embers.

## ODYSSEUS

Dawn found Odysseus at the water's edge.

He stood with his feet in the surf, watching the sun rise over Troy. The walls caught the light first—pale gold limestone, forty feet high, the joints fitted so tight a knife blade couldn't find purchase. He'd tried once, years ago. The blade had snapped.

The Scaean Gate faced the sea, its bronze doors green with salt. Above it, the watchtowers rose another twenty feet, their crenellations sharp against the brightening sky. He counted the sentries by habit: four on the left tower, three on the right, two more pacing the section of wall between. The morning watch, just settled in. In an hour they'd grow bored, start talking, stop scanning the beach.

He'd learned every tower, every gate, every section of stone. The crack in the northwest corner that widened each spring when the rains came. The place where the foundation met bedrock and the wall sat a hand's width lower than everywhere else. The section above the Dardanian Gate where the limestone had been patched with sandstone—an old repair, before his time, but the colors didn't quite match.

Beyond the walls, smoke still rose from yesterday's raid. The southern road was visible from here, winding through fields that had been green five years ago. Now they were black stubble and ash. The farmhouses were gone—not ruins, just absence. Flat places where buildings used to stand.

Closer to the city, the ground was cratered and scarred. Siege trenches they'd dug and abandoned. Assault ramps they'd built and the Trojans had burned. The bones of a battering ram, stripped for timber, half-buried in sand.

A ship was rounding the headland. Supply ship from Euboea, by the sail—three weeks late, but here. He watched it tack toward the beach, riding low with cargo. Grain, probably. Maybe oil. The men would eat full rations tonight.

The Greek camp spread behind him, larger than some cities now. Wooden barracks where tents used to stand. A forge, a tannery, three temples, a whorehouse. Roads worn into the sand, packed hard by five years of feet. A whole city built for the purpose of destroying another city.

Odysseus looked back at the walls. Still standing. Still gold in the morning light.

He turned toward the camp. There was work to do.

## CASSANDRA

From the walls of Troy, Cassandra watched.

She saw the Greek camp stirring, the smoke of cook fires rising, the tiny figures moving between tents. She saw the ships in the harbor, the walls casting long shadows, the no-man's-land between them littered with the debris of five years of war.

And she saw what no one else could see.

A horse at the gates.

A baby falling.

Fire.

"Cassandra."

She turned. Helen, come to bring her breakfast.

"Are you all right?"

Cassandra looked at her.

"The horse is coming," Cassandra said. "Someday. When the war has gone on so long that everyone forgets there was ever anything else. When the children born this year are old enough to hold spears. That's when it will come."

"What horse?"

But Cassandra was looking past her now, at the sea, at the sky, at something only she could see.

Helen set down the breakfast tray. Sat beside her, took her hand.

"Eat something," she said. "Please."

Cassandra let herself be led to the table. Let Helen put bread in her hands, guide the cup to her lips.

Outside, the war went on.
