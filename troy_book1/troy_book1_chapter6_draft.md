# Chapter Six: The Wall

---

The argument had been going on for an hour.

Odysseus sat at the back of the council tent, watching the kings shout at each other, and thought about how much he hated this war.

"—three weeks late! Three weeks! My men are eating half-rations, and you're telling me to be patient?"

"The storms—"

"There are always storms! There are always excuses! Meanwhile, my soldiers are starting to look at the horses like they're wondering how they'd taste!"

Agamemnon raised his hand. The shouting subsided, grudgingly.

"The supply ships will arrive when they arrive. Until then, we make do."

"Make do with what? Air? Sand?"

Odysseus studied Agamemnon while the others argued. The high king had aged badly in the five years since Aulis—his hair more grey than gold now, his face heavier, his patience worn thin. He still commanded, still presided, but the fire that had driven him to sacrifice his daughter for this war had dimmed into something colder. Something that looked a lot like exhaustion.

Achilles's seat was empty. It usually was, these days.

"Where's the son of Peleus?" someone muttered. "Too good to sit through supply meetings?"

"He's training," Patroclus said from his place near the wall. "As he does every morning."

"Training for what? We haven't had a real battle in months."

"Perhaps that's why he trains. To stay ready."

The argument circled back to grain, to ships, to the endless logistics of keeping a hundred thousand men fed and armed and pointed at walls that never fell. Odysseus let it wash over him. He'd heard it all before. He'd been hearing it for five years.

When the shouting reached its peak, he stood.

"There's another option."

The tent went quiet. Odysseus didn't speak often in council—he saved his words for when they'd matter—and when he did, men listened.

"The coastal villages to the south. Trojan allies. They've been supplying the city for years—grain, livestock, timber. We've left them alone because raiding villages isn't honorable." He let the word hang in the air. "But neither is starving."

Silence.

"You're suggesting we attack civilians," someone said.

"I'm suggesting we attack enemy supply lines. The fact that they're defended by farmers instead of soldiers doesn't change the strategic calculation."

More silence. Odysseus could see the kings thinking it through—the ones who'd been complaining loudest about rations suddenly considering the alternative.

"It's not... proper," Nestor said slowly. The old king of Pylos, ancient even when this war began, now so frail he had to be carried to councils. "War should be between warriors."

"War should be over by now," Odysseus replied. "It's not. We adapt or we starve. Those are the choices."

Agamemnon nodded slowly. "Achilles. He's been asking for action. Give him a dozen ships and a week. Let him remind the Trojans that their walls don't protect everyone."

The decision was made. The council dissolved into smaller arguments—who would go, how many ships, which villages to target. Odysseus slipped out while the others were still talking.

Agamemnon remained seated as the tent emptied.

When the last of them had gone, he reached into his robe and withdrew a pale blue ribbon, worn soft from years of handling. He didn't look at it often—months would pass, sometimes, before he remembered it was there. But moments like this, when the walls still stood and the years stretched on and the war demanded more than anyone had imagined, his hand would find it. A reflex. A habit he couldn't quite extinguish.

Iphigenia had given it to him when she was small. A good-luck charm, she'd called it. He'd kept it ever since.

Five years. Five years since the altar, since the knife, since the wind came. Five years since he'd proven what he was willing to pay. And here he sat, grey and tired, the walls still standing, the war nowhere near its end.

He thought: *It should have been enough.*

He thought: *It should have bought more than this.*

The ribbon was faded now, the blue gone pale. He ran his thumb across it once, feeling the softness of the fabric, and then he tucked it away again.

If he had to make the choice again—today, now, knowing what it would cost—would he?

The question surfaced sometimes, late at night, in the silence between one crisis and the next. He examined it the way he examined all threats: coldly, carefully, without sentiment.

Yes. He would do it again. The war still needed winning. The walls still needed falling. And he was still the man who could do what must be done.

That was the worst part. Not that the choice haunted him—but that it didn't. He'd paid with his daughter's life, and he'd do it again, and the only thing he felt was tired.

He rose from the table and went to find his captains. There were raids to plan, supplies to manage, a siege to maintain.

The war went on.

The morning sun hit him like a physical blow. Five years of Trojan summers, and he still wasn't used to the heat. Ithaca was cool, green, swept by sea breezes. This place was an oven.

He walked the camp without destination, letting his feet carry him through the maze of tents and cook fires and latrines. The camp had grown permanent over the years—wooden structures replacing canvas, roads worn into the sand, a whole city built for the purpose of destroying another city.

A group of soldiers sat in the shade of a supply wagon, gambling with knucklebones. Odysseus paused to watch.

"...three winters now since I seen my boy. He was walking when I left. Now his mother writes he's asking questions about me. Wants to know when I'm coming home."

"What do you tell him?"

"What can I tell him? I don't know when I'm coming home. I don't know if I'm coming home."

Odysseus walked on.

Near the edge of the camp, a funeral pyre was burning. Not a warrior's pyre—this was smaller, sadder. A sickness had swept through the Argive tents last month. Thirty men dead, more still recovering. The healers called it camp fever. The soldiers called it Troy's revenge.

He found Achilles at the Myrmidon encampment, preparing for the raid. His men were loading ships—weapons, armor, empty sacks for grain. They moved with the efficiency of long practice.

"You heard," Achilles said without turning.

"I suggested it."

"Did you." Achilles turned now. He looked different than he had that first day on the beach—leaner, harder, something hungry in his eyes that hadn't been there before. "Getting your hands dirty for once."

"We all have dirty hands by now."

Achilles almost smiled. "True enough." He went back to inspecting a coil of rope. "I'll take twelve ships. Hit the villages at night. Be back before they can organize a response."

"It's not glory."

"No. It's theft." Achilles tossed the rope to a waiting soldier. "But it's movement. I've been sitting on this beach for five years, Odysseus. Watching those walls. Waiting for something to happen. Do you know what that's like?"

"I know exactly what it's like."

"Then you know I'll take anything. Raid villages, steal grain, burn farms—I don't care. As long as I'm doing something."

Odysseus watched him for a moment. The greatest warrior of his generation, reduced to raiding fishing villages for supplies. The glory he'd chosen, the early death he'd embraced—this wasn't what he'd imagined. Odysseus could see it in the tightness around his eyes, the restless energy that never quite discharged.

"The walls will fall," Odysseus said. "Eventually."

"Eventually." Achilles's voice was flat. "You've been saying that for five years. Eventually. Someday. When the time is right." He looked at the distant walls, pale and solid in the morning light. "How many men die waiting for eventually? How many more years do we sit here, growing old, while those walls just... stand?"

Odysseus had no answer. He'd asked himself the same question a thousand times.

"Do what you need to do," he said. "Bring back the grain. We'll figure out the rest."

Achilles nodded. Already turning away, already focused on the raid.

Odysseus walked back toward the main camp, the sun beating down on his shoulders, the walls of Troy shimmering in the heat.

---

Helen woke to Paris's hands on her body.

He was still half-asleep, his movements automatic, familiar. His fingers traced the curve of her hip, her waist, found the places that made her breath catch. After five years, he knew her body as well as he knew his own.

"Again?" Her voice was rough with sleep.

"Complaining?" His mouth found her throat. She could feel him smiling against her skin.

"Never."

She turned toward him. The grey pre-dawn light filtered through the curtains, enough to see the planes of his face—softer in sleep, younger. The face she'd left everything for.

The face that had launched a thousand ships. That was what they said about her, but it wasn't true. Her face hadn't launched anything. It was his face, his smile, the way he'd looked at her across Menelaus's table that first night. Like she was the only person in the room. Like she was the only person in the world.

He looked at her that way still. After the siege, the death, the years of guilt. He still looked at her like she was everything.

She pulled him closer. Found his mouth with hers. His hands moved with practiced efficiency—he knew exactly how to touch her now, exactly what rhythm to set, exactly how to make her forget. And she let herself forget, for a while. Let the world narrow to this room, this bed, the heat of his body against hers.

After, they lay tangled together, her head on his chest, his hand tracing patterns on her back.

"Stay," he murmured. "All day. We'll have food brought up. We won't leave this room."

"I can't. The healing house—"

"The healing house can survive without you for one day."

"Can it?" She traced a finger along his collarbone. "Three men came in yesterday with infected wounds. Two more with camp fever. The healers are overwhelmed."

"Then let them be overwhelmed. You've done enough."

She sat up, and something in her face made him stop.

"I haven't done anything," she said. "Not anything that matters. Every bandage I change, every fever I tend—it doesn't bring back a single person who died because of me."

"Helen—"

"I'm not looking for absolution. I know there isn't any." She slid out of bed, began gathering her clothes. "But I can't just stay in this room and pretend the world outside doesn't exist. I tried that. It doesn't work."

Paris watched her dress. She could feel his eyes on her—still wanting, still hungry. After everything.

"Tonight," she said.

"Tonight." He smiled, but there was something sad in it now. Something that hadn't been there in the beginning. "I'll be here. I'm always here."

She leaned down, kissed him quickly. Then she left, stepping out of their private world and into the city that hated her.

---

The healing house had been a temple once, before the war. Now the statues were pushed against the walls, the altar covered with bandages and herb pouches, the sacred space given over to the broken and the dying.

Helen moved through the rows of pallets, changing bandages, checking wounds, doing the hundred small tasks she'd learned over five years. The Trojan healers had resisted her at first—what did a Spartan queen know about medicine?—but she'd learned. She'd watched, and helped, and eventually they'd accepted her presence if not her history.

A soldier grabbed her wrist as she passed. Young, maybe twenty, his face flushed with fever.

"You're her," he said. "Helen."

"Yes."

"My brother. He was at the landing. First day." His grip tightened. "Seventeen years old. He didn't even make it off the beach."

Helen didn't pull away. She didn't flinch. She had learned not to flinch. "I'm sorry."

"Are you? Are you really?"

"Yes." She kept her voice steady. "I'm sorry for your brother. I'm sorry for all of them."

The soldier stared at her. Looking for something—a flinch, a lie, something he could rage against. She gave him nothing. She'd had this conversation a hundred times.

Finally, his grip loosened. He turned away, toward the wall.

Helen finished his bandage and moved to the next patient.

Later, outside, she sat against the temple wall and let herself breathe. The sun was high now, the streets empty—everyone who could be inside was inside, escaping the heat.

Footsteps. She looked up.

A woman, older, well-dressed. One of the noble families who had lost sons in the fighting. Helen recognized her but didn't know her name.

"The healers say you're useful," the woman said. No greeting, no preamble. "They say you work hard. That you don't complain."

"I try."

"Why?"

"Because I have to do something. Because sitting in my chambers waiting to be hated isn't enough."

The woman studied her. "It doesn't make up for anything. You know that."

"I know."

"All the bandages in the world won't bring back my son."

"No. They won't."

"Then why bother?"

Helen looked at her hands. Rough now, callused, stained with other people's blood. Not the hands of a queen. Not the hands that had trembled when she'd touched her sleeping daughter's hair, that last night in Sparta.

Hermione would be eight now. Old enough to understand that her mother had left her. Old enough to hate.

"Because it's something," she said. "Because I can't do nothing. Because—" She stopped, tried again. "Because if I'm going to be here, I should be useful. It doesn't make up for anything. But it's what I can do."

The woman was silent for a long moment. Then, grudgingly: "My daughter works here too. In the afternoons. She says you're kind to the soldiers."

"I try to be."

"That counts for something." The woman turned to go. "Not much. But something."

She walked away. Helen stayed against the wall, watching the empty street, feeling the weight of something that was almost acceptance.

Almost.

---

The tower was hot and close, but Cassandra didn't seem to notice.

She sat by the window, staring at nothing, her hands folded in her lap. She'd lost weight again—Helen could see it in the sharpness of her cheekbones, the way her dress hung loose on her frame.

"I brought food," Helen said. She set the tray on the table: bread, cheese, figs, a cup of watered wine. "The bread is fresh. I made sure."

Cassandra didn't respond.

Helen sat down across from her. This was their ritual now, almost every evening—Helen bringing food, sitting with her, talking about nothing. Sometimes Cassandra responded. Sometimes she didn't. Either way, Helen came.

"There was a boy today," Helen said. "At the healing house. He couldn't have been more than fifteen. Arrow wound in his shoulder—he'll live, but it'll scar badly. He kept asking for his mother."

Cassandra's eyes moved, slowly, focusing on something Helen couldn't see.

"The ships are coming back," she murmured. "But they're not the same ships."

"What ships?"

"He buries the wrong body. He doesn't know." Cassandra's voice was dreamy, distant. "He thinks it's the right one, but it isn't. He'll find out later. When it's too late."

Helen didn't ask what it meant. She'd learned not to. The visions came and went, fragments of things that hadn't happened yet, and asking only seemed to make Cassandra retreat further.

"Eat something," she said instead. "Please. For me."

Cassandra looked at the food. Reached out, slowly, and picked up a piece of bread. She held it but didn't eat.

"You're the only one who comes," she said. Her voice was clearer now, almost normal. "Do you know that? Everyone else is afraid of me. My parents, my brothers—they visit sometimes, but they're afraid. They look at me like I'm a disease they might catch."

"I'm not afraid of you."

"No." Cassandra almost smiled. "You're afraid of yourself. That's different."

Helen had no answer to that.

"We're the same," Cassandra continued. "Both of us cursed. Both of us trapped. Both of us waiting for something terrible that we can't stop."

She looked at Helen then—really looked, her eyes focusing with unusual clarity.

"You're different now," she said. "Less gold. More—" She trailed off, searching for a word that wouldn't come. Her hand lifted, almost touched Helen's face. "More like hands that have held things that break."

"What are we waiting for?"

Cassandra's eyes drifted back to the window. Back to whatever she saw there.

"The horse is getting closer," she whispered. "I can hear the teeth."

Helen felt something cold move through her chest. "Cassandra—"

But Cassandra was gone again, retreating into whatever place she went when the visions took her. Her hand was still holding the bread, but she'd forgotten it was there.

Helen stayed until the sun went down. Then she kissed Cassandra's forehead, left the food on the table, and walked back through the darkening streets to the room where Paris was waiting.

---

The camp was quiet when Odysseus walked the perimeter.

He'd developed the habit years ago—a circuit of the fortifications, checking sentries, looking for weaknesses. He told himself it was strategic, but the truth was simpler. He couldn't sleep. Hadn't been able to for months.

He was thinking about Ithaca when he saw Palamedes. Not the kingdom—the kitchen. Penelope mending a fishing net by lamplight, Telemachus asleep in her lap, the smell of olive oil and salt. The stone wall he'd been building that last morning. It would need repair by now. Five years of weather, and no one to check the mortar.

Palamedes.

The man was walking the same circuit, from the opposite direction. They met at the northeast corner of the camp, where the fortifications overlooked the beach.

"Odysseus."

"Palamedes."

Neither moved. The moon was bright enough to see by, and Odysseus could make out the other man's face—leaner than it had been, weathered by the same five years that had weathered them all.

"Couldn't sleep?" Palamedes asked.

"Something like that."

"I've been reviewing the supply situation. There might be a way to stretch the grain further—rotating the distribution, prioritizing the units most likely to see combat."

"That's a good idea."

"I'll bring it to Agamemnon tomorrow."

"You should."

They stood in silence. Below them, the waves lapped at the sand, a sound Odysseus had heard so often he barely noticed it anymore.

"We could end this faster," Palamedes said. "If we worked together. You and I—we see things the others don't. We could coordinate, plan, make this siege actually work."

"Yes. We could."

"But you won't." It wasn't a question.

Odysseus looked at him. This man who had put Telemachus in the path of a plow. Who had forced him to come here, to leave his wife and son, to spend five years on this beach watching men die for a war he'd never wanted.

"No," he said. "I won't."

Palamedes nodded slowly. "Ithaca. You haven't forgotten."

"I'll never forget."

"I was doing my duty. The oath—"

"I know what you were doing." Odysseus's voice was quiet. "I understand the logic. I even understand the necessity. But understanding isn't the same as forgiving."

Palamedes studied him for a long moment. Then he smiled—a strange, sad smile.

"I think I knew that. Even then, when I put your son in the furrow. I knew you'd never let it go." He turned to walk away. "I suppose I should watch my back."

"I suppose you should."

Palamedes disappeared into the darkness between tents. Odysseus stayed at the corner of the fortifications, looking out at the sea.

The cold thing in his chest—the thing that had been there since Ithaca—hadn't faded. If anything, it had grown harder, more patient. He could wait. He was good at waiting.

Someday, when the moment was right, Palamedes would pay for what he'd done.

But not tonight. Tonight, there was a war to manage, a siege to maintain, a hundred thousand men to keep alive.

He resumed his circuit, checking the sentries, counting the hours until dawn.

---

The horns woke Hector from a dream of peace.

He was on his feet before he was fully conscious, reaching for his sword, his armor. Andromache was sitting up in bed, her eyes wide.

"What is it?"

"I don't know. Stay here."

He ran through the palace, past servants and guards who were asking the same questions. The horns kept sounding—not the pattern for a direct assault, something else. Something urgent.

He reached the walls. His captains were already there, pointing south.

Smoke. Orange light on the horizon.

"What's happening?"

"A raid, my lord. The Greeks hit one of the outer villages. The farms along the southern road."

"How many?"

"Reports say a dozen ships. Flying the Myrmidon banner."

Achilles.

The name hit him like a fist. He was back on the beach suddenly, five years ago, watching a single warrior cut through his men like they were nothing. Their eyes meeting across the chaos. That cold recognition moving through his chest.

*This is the man.*

The man who would kill farmers and children. The man who was still out there, waiting.

Hector gripped the parapet, staring at the distant glow. The village was too far to reach in time—by the time they organized a sortie, the Greeks would be gone. But maybe, if they moved fast—

"Ready the cavalry. Two hundred men. We'll try to intercept them before they reach their ships."

"My lord, by the time we—"

"I know. Do it anyway."

---

They rode through the darkness, pushing the horses as hard as they dared.

The night was warm, the road familiar. Hector had ridden this way a hundred times—to inspect the outer defenses, to reassure the farmers that Troy would protect them. That the walls kept everyone safe.

The walls hadn't kept them safe. Nothing had.

They smelled the village before they saw it. Smoke and something worse—the smell of burning that had a different quality when there were bodies in it. Hector had learned to recognize that smell over five years of war.

They crested a rise, and the village spread out below them.

It was gone.

Not damaged. Not raided. Gone. The houses were burning, the grain stores collapsed, the livestock pens torn open and empty. Bodies in the street—some villagers, some Greeks who hadn't made it back to the ships. The fires were starting to die now, having consumed everything they could reach.

"Spread out," Hector said. His voice sounded strange in his own ears. "Search for survivors. Bring anyone you find."

His men moved into the ruins. Hector dismounted, walked through the destruction.

A house, still smoldering. The door was open—broken in, from the look of it. Inside, shapes that had been furniture, that had been belongings, that had been a life.

A shape that had been a person.

He moved on.

Another house. This one hadn't burned completely—the walls were standing, the roof half-collapsed. He stepped through the doorway.

The smell hit him first. Blood and smoke and something else, something he didn't want to name.

There were two of them. A woman, lying near the door—she'd been trying to run, maybe. And near the back of the house, almost hidden by fallen beams—

A child.

A girl, five or six years old. She was curled on her side, her arms wrapped around something. Hector moved closer, knelt beside her.

A toy. A wooden horse, crudely carved, the paint worn from handling. She was holding it the way children held things they loved—tight, protective, as if nothing in the world could make them let go.

She wasn't burned. Trampled, maybe, in the chaos. Or struck by something. It didn't matter how. What mattered was she was dead, and she was holding a toy, and her face was frozen in an expression that might have been surprise or fear or both.

Hector knelt in the ashes and looked at her.

Five years. Five years of war, of strategy, of defending walls and managing supplies and telling himself that they were protecting their people. Five years of believing the walls were enough.

This was what the walls protected. This was what they'd saved.

A dead child, clutching a wooden horse.

"My lord."

He looked up. A captain, silhouetted in the doorway.

"The Greeks are gone. We found tracks leading to the shore—they've already sailed. We have some survivors. Maybe thirty."

"Out of how many?"

The captain hesitated. "The village had two hundred people, my lord. Maybe more."

Thirty out of two hundred. The rest dead, or taken, or scattered into the hills.

Hector looked back at the girl.

"Gather the dead," he said. "All of them. We'll bring them back to Troy for proper burial."

"My lord, that's—there are dozens of bodies. Maybe a hundred. The horses can't—"

"Find wagons. Find carts. Carry them if you have to." He stood, and his knees ached from kneeling. When had that started? "They were our people. They died because we couldn't protect them. The least we can do is bury them properly."

The captain nodded and left.

Hector bent down and picked up the girl. She weighed almost nothing.

---

They reached the gates at dawn.

Word had spread. The streets were lined with people—silent, watching. Some were crying. Some just stared, their faces blank with shock.

On the palace steps, Priam stood waiting. He had come down himself, refusing his attendants' pleas that he wait inside. He was bareheaded, his white hair disheveled by the morning wind, and he watched the wagons of the dead pass with an expression that was beyond grief—something older and heavier, the face of a man who had outlived too many of his children's hopes.

Hector rode at the head of the column. Behind him, wagons carried the dead. Behind that, the survivors walked—thirty people, mostly women and children, their eyes empty.

He was still holding the girl.

He'd carried her all the way from the village. His arms ached, his back screamed, but he couldn't put her down. Couldn't hand her to someone else. She was his responsibility now.

Andromache was waiting at the palace gates. Her face went white when she saw what he was carrying.

"Hector—"

"Our son." His voice cracked. "Where is he?"

"Asleep. In the nursery. Hector, what happened?"

"I need to see him. Now."

She led him through the palace, past servants who shrank against the walls, past guards who looked away. Into the nursery, where Astyanax lay sleeping in his bed.

Their son. Five years old now—born in the first months of the siege, knowing no world but this one. He had Andromache's eyes, Hector's jaw, a face that changed every day into something new. He was sucking his thumb, the way he always did when he slept deeply.

Hector stood in the doorway, the dead girl in his arms, looking at his living son.

"Hector." Andromache's voice was gentle. "You need to put her down."

He didn't move.

"Hector."

"This is what it is," he said. His voice was strange—flat, distant. "This is what it's going to be. For years. For however long this lasts. Children dying. Homes burning. And nothing I do will stop it."

"The walls—"

"The walls keep them out of the city. They don't keep anyone safe." He finally looked at her. "I thought I understood. When the fleet came. I thought I knew what war was. What it meant. I didn't know anything."

Andromache took the girl from his arms. Gently, carefully, as if she might still feel pain.

The child weighed almost nothing. Dark hair, matted with ash. A face that might have been peaceful if not for the dust sealing her eyes shut. She could have been any child. She could have been—

Andromache looked at the bed where Astyanax slept, his small chest rising and falling, his fist curled against his cheek. Then she looked at the girl in her arms. The same size. The same age, perhaps. The same fragile bones that broke so easily when the world turned cruel.

Something cold moved through her chest. Not grief—she didn't know this child. Something worse than grief. Recognition.

*This is what the war wants. This is what it will take, if we let it.*

"We'll find her family," she said. Her voice was steady. She made it steady. "If they survived. If not—"

"Bury her properly. With the others."

"I will."

He looked at his son one more time. Still sleeping. Still peaceful. Still innocent of everything happening outside these walls.

"I need to go," he said. "There are reports to file. Defenses to check. Plans to make."

"You need to sleep."

"I can't."

"Hector—"

"I can't." He turned away from the nursery, from his son, from the dead girl his wife was holding. "There's always more war. There's always more to do."

He walked away, his footsteps echoing in the empty hall.

Andromache stood in the doorway of her son's room, holding someone else's daughter, watching her husband disappear into the palace. The dead child's weight was nothing. Her son's sleeping breath was everything.

*Children not yet born will pick up swords.*

She had heard Cassandra's prophecies before. Everyone had. Fragments that made no sense, warnings that slipped away like morning mist. But sometimes, in the dark hours, Andromache wondered what else the princess had seen. What she had seen about this child, this son, this small life sleeping in his bed while the world burned around him.

She would not ask. Asking would make it real.

She looked at Astyanax one last time. Then she went to find the servants. There were bodies to bury.

---

The raiders returned at midday.

Odysseus watched the ships come in, heavy with grain and livestock. Efficient. Professional. Exactly what they'd needed.

The men unloaded quickly, joking among themselves, pleased with their success. The captives came last—mostly women, stumbling down the gangplanks, their faces blank. They would be distributed among the kings, as was custom. Property, now. The spoils of war.

Odysseus found Achilles standing apart from the celebration, watching the unloading with an expression Odysseus couldn't read.

"Good raid?"

"Successful." Achilles's voice was flat.

"That's not what I asked."

Achilles didn't answer. He was watching one of the captive women—young, dark-haired, pretty in a common way. She was looking around at the camp, at the ships, at everything except the men who surrounded her.

"They didn't fight back," Achilles said finally. "Most of them. They saw us coming and they ran, or they hid, or they just... stood there. Waiting."

"They're farmers. Fishermen. They've never held a sword."

"I know. That's the point." Achilles turned to face him. "I came here to fight warriors. To test myself against the best Troy had. To earn glory." He laughed, a bitter sound. "And instead I'm butchering farmers and burning grain stores and—"

He stopped. There was a boy, maybe twelve, who had tried to run. Achilles could still see the back of his tunic, the bare feet kicking up dust. One of the Myrmidons had caught him.

"There was a boy," he said. "Running. He had a fishing spear—a toy, really. Couldn't have hurt anyone with it." Achilles's jaw tightened. "I told myself it was necessary. That we needed the supplies. That this is what war requires."

He thought of Agamemnon saying the same words over Iphigenia. *Necessary. What the mission requires.*

Something cold moved through his chest.

"Patroclus made me promise something once," he said quietly. "Before we sailed. That if I ever became like Agamemnon—if I ever put necessity above honor—he'd kill me himself."

Odysseus said nothing.

"I'm starting to understand why I asked him for that."

"The walls will fall," Odysseus said. Because it was what he always said. Because there was nothing else to say.

"You keep telling me that. Someday. Eventually." Achilles started walking toward the Myrmidon camp. "I'm starting to wonder if you actually believe it."

Patroclus was waiting at the edge of the camp. He fell into step beside Achilles, their heads close together, speaking in voices too low for Odysseus to hear.

Odysseus watched them go. Thought about what kind of man Achilles was becoming. What kind of men they were all becoming.

Then he went to oversee the distribution of supplies.

---

Helen heard the news before she saw the wagons.

Voices in the street, spreading the word: a village had been raided. The dead were being brought back for burial. Hundreds of them.

She went to the walls.

From the battlements, she could see the column approaching—wagons piled with bodies, covered with cloth that couldn't quite hide what was underneath. Survivors walking behind, their faces empty.

At the head of the column, Hector. Carrying something.

A child.

Helen watched him pass through the gates, watched the silent crowd part around him, watched him carry the dead girl into the palace.

"This is your fault."

She turned. The woman from the healing house—the one with the dead son—was standing nearby, her face twisted with grief and rage.

"You know that. All of it. Every person who dies. Every child. Every house that burns."

"I know."

"Then how do you live with it? How do you wake up every morning and breathe and eat and—" The woman's voice broke. "How do you do it?"

Helen looked at the smoke on the horizon, the distant sea, the walls that kept her prisoner.

"I don't know," she said. "I just do."

The woman stared at her. Looking for something—an excuse, a justification, something she could hate. But there was nothing. Just a woman standing on a wall, accepting what she couldn't change.

The woman walked away.

Helen stayed on the walls until the smoke faded, watching the Greek camp, watching the sea, watching everything she'd caused.

That night, Paris found Helen on the balcony.

She was staring at the funeral pyres, her arms wrapped around herself. He stood in the doorway, watching her, knowing what she was thinking because he was thinking it too.

"I heard them bringing the bodies in," he said. "From the walls. I watched."

She didn't turn.

"There was a girl. Hector was carrying her." Paris moved to stand beside Helen, looking at the same fires. "I kept thinking—she never did anything. She was just living her life, in a village that had the bad luck to be near Troy. And now she's dead because of a choice I made five years ago."

"You can't know that. The Greeks—"

"The Greeks came here because of me. Every death, every burned village, every child who—" His voice broke. He steadied himself. "I know what I did. I've always known. I just couldn't... I couldn't let myself feel it. Not really."

Helen finally looked at him. Her eyes were red, but she wasn't crying. She'd stopped crying years ago.

"Why now?"

"I don't know. Maybe because I can't hide from it anymore. Maybe because I've been hiding so long that the hiding itself has become another kind of cowardice." He laughed, but there was no humor in it. "You'd think almost dying would have taught me something. It didn't. I just... went back to pretending."

She reached for him then—not with desire, but with something older. Her hand found his, squeezed.

"I tried going to the healing house today," Paris said. "To help. The way you do."

"What happened?"

"A man spit at me. Called me the Trojan whore's husband." He shrugged. "He wasn't wrong. About any of it."

"Paris—"

"I left. I couldn't stay there, with all of them looking at me like that. Like I was the cause of everything." He pulled his hand away, ran it through his hair. "And the worst part is—they're right. I am the cause. And I can't do anything about it. I can't fight, I can't help, I can't even die properly."

They stood in silence, watching the pyres burn.

Later, in bed, he reached for her the way he always did—hands finding familiar places, mouth against her throat. The ritual that had sustained them through five years of siege.

She let him. Because it was easier than talking. Because his body was the one thing that had never blamed her.

But after, lying in the darkness, she said:

"A child died today. A little girl. She was holding a toy."

Paris was quiet.

"I saw them bring her in. Hector was carrying her. He looked—" She stopped. "I've never seen him look like that."

"Helen—"

"This is because of us. All of it. The village. The dead. That little girl."

"You can't—"

"Don't." Her voice was flat. "Don't tell me it's not our fault. Don't tell me we didn't have a choice. Don't tell me the gods did this, or fate did this, or anything else. I'm so tired of that."

He didn't respond. His hand found hers in the dark. Held it.

They lay there, not speaking, not sleeping. Outside, the funeral pyres were burning—Helen could smell the smoke through the window.

"I love you," Paris said finally.

"I know."

"Does that mean anything? After everything? Does it help?"

She thought about it. Really thought, for the first time in a long time.

"No," she said. "It doesn't help. Nothing helps." She squeezed his hand. "But it's something. It's the only thing I have."

Paris was quiet for a long moment. Then, softly: "I used to think loving you was the best thing I ever did. The bravest thing. Choosing you over everything else."

"And now?"

"Now I think it was the easiest thing. Easier than being wise. Easier than being good." He turned his head on the pillow, looked at her profile in the darkness. "I'm not sorry I love you. I can't be sorry for that. But I'm sorry for what my love cost everyone else. I'm sorry I didn't have the courage to love you and also be a better man."

Helen didn't respond. There was nothing to say.

They lay in the dark, holding hands, listening to the city mourn.

Hector found Andromache in their chambers.

He'd been walking the walls for hours—checking defenses, speaking with captains, doing all the things a commander was supposed to do. Now it was late, and he was tired, and he didn't know where else to go.

She was sitting by the window, a cup of untouched wine in her hand. She looked up when he entered.

"The girl," he said. "Did you find her family?"

"Her mother was among the dead. Her father is missing—maybe escaped, maybe taken." Andromache set down the wine. "She had a grandmother in the city. Old. Frail. But alive."

"Did you tell her?"

"Yes."

"How did she take it?"

"How do you think?"

Hector crossed to the window, stood beside her. Looking out at the city, at the distant glow of funeral pyres.

"How long can this go on?" he asked.

"As long as it has to."

"Years. Cassandra said—" He stopped.

"Said what?"

"Children not yet born will pick up swords. That's what she said. I don't know what it means, but—" He shook his head. "If she's right, this war will last longer than anyone imagines."

"Cassandra says many things." Andromache's voice was careful, measured. She had heard the princess speak of walls falling, of fire in the streets, of things she could not let herself imagine. Once, in the early days of the siege, she had almost asked Cassandra directly—*what do you see for my son?*—but something in the princess's eyes had stopped her. Some doors were better left closed. "Not all prophecies come to pass."

"She's usually right. That's the problem. She's always right, and no one believes her, and then the things she said come true." He turned to face his wife. "What if she's right about this? What if this goes on for ten years? Twenty? What if our son grows up in this siege, never knowing anything but war?"

Andromache was quiet for a moment. Then she stood, took his face in her hands.

"Then we protect him. We do what we can. We teach him to be strong, and smart, and good. And we survive."

"And if surviving means watching more villages burn? More children die?"

"Then we watch. And we remember. And we make them pay for every single one."

He looked at her. This woman he'd married before the war, who had become something harder and sharper over these years. Who had watched him change and changed alongside him.

"I love you," he said.

"I know." She kissed him. "I love you too. Now sleep. Tomorrow there will be more war."

"There's always more war."

"Yes. There is. So sleep while you can."

He let her lead him to bed. Let her wrap her arms around him. Let himself, for a moment, believe that these walls could protect the people he loved.

Outside, the funeral pyres burned down to embers.

The siege continued.

Dawn found Odysseus at the water's edge.

He stood with his feet in the surf, watching the sun rise over Troy. The walls were pale gold in the morning light, beautiful in a way he'd never be able to hate. After five years, he knew every tower, every gate, every section of stone. He'd studied them more than he'd ever studied anything.

And still they stood.

Four years—almost five now. Five years of siege, of politics, of managing egos and supplies and the thousand small crises that kept an army from falling apart. Five years of watching men grow old and die, of writing letters to wives he'd never see again, of telling himself that eventually, someday, the war would end.

The walls still stood. Troy still stood.

But they'd made progress. Inch by inch, village by village, they'd tightened the noose. The outer defenses were gone now—raided, burned, abandoned. The Trojan allies were wavering, some switching sides, others simply refusing to send more supplies. The city was still strong, but it was weaker than it had been. Weaker than it would be next year, and the year after that.

It would take longer than anyone had expected. It would cost more than anyone had imagined. But it would end. Everything ended.

A ship was rounding the headland—supply ship from Greece, finally. The men would eat full rations tonight. Tomorrow there would be another council, another argument, another crisis to manage. But that was tomorrow.

Today, the sun was rising, and he was still alive.

He turned back toward the camp. There was work to do.

---

From the walls of Troy, Cassandra watched.

She saw the Greek camp stirring, the smoke of cook fires rising, the tiny figures moving between tents. She saw the ships in the harbor, the walls casting long shadows, the no-man's-land between them littered with the debris of five years of war.

And she saw what no one else could see.

A horse, vast and dark, standing at the gates. Its belly swelling, pregnant with metal and death.

A baby falling, falling, the walls rushing up to meet him.

Fire in the palace. Fire in the streets. Fire consuming everything she'd ever known.

"Cassandra."

She turned. Helen, come to bring her breakfast. As she did every morning now, faithful and gentle and doomed.

"Are you all right?"

Cassandra looked at her. This woman who had caused everything, who carried the weight of it every day, who kept living despite the hate and the guilt and the knowledge of what she'd done.

"The horse is coming," Cassandra said. "Someday. When the war has gone on so long that everyone forgets there was ever anything else. When the children born this year are old enough to hold spears. That's when it will come."

"What horse?"

But Cassandra was looking past her now, at the sea, at the sky, at something only she could see.

"The teeth," she whispered. "So many teeth."

Helen set down the breakfast tray. Sat beside her, took her hand.

"Eat something," she said. "Please."

Cassandra let herself be led to the table. Let Helen put bread in her hands, guide the cup to her lips. These small kindnesses that changed nothing, that couldn't stop what was coming.

Outside, the war went on.

The siege continued.

And in the belly of the future, the horse was waiting.
