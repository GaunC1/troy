# Chapter Four: The Blood Price

---

The lamp had burned low, the oil nearly gone.

Agamemnon sat at his table, his hands flat on the wood, his eyes on nothing. Outside, the camp was quiet—the restless quiet of men who had waited too long, who were beginning to wonder if the waiting would ever end.

*Your daughter. Nothing else will suffice.*

He thought through the options. He had been thinking through them for hours, turning them over like stones, examining each from every angle.

Refuse. The wind never blows. The army, already restless, grows mutinous. The kings begin to leave—one at first, then others, then the whole grand enterprise collapses like a tent with its poles removed. He sails home to Mycenae having assembled the greatest army in history and accomplished nothing. His enemies laugh. His allies reconsider. Everything he's built crumbles.

Or.

He sends for Iphigenia. The goddess is appeased. The wind blows. The fleet sails. Troy falls. He returns as the conqueror of the greatest city in the world, the man who united Greece, the king who will be remembered for a thousand years.

He thought about his daughter. Her face at dinner, asking about Achilles. Her excitement. Her trust.

He thought about Clytemnestra. What she would say. What she would do.

He thought about the thousand ships in the harbor, their sails hanging limp.

The lamp guttered. He watched the flame struggle, almost die, then catch again on the last of the oil.

"Scribe," he called.

The man appeared at the tent entrance, bleary-eyed. "My lord?"

"A letter. To my wife."

The scribe fumbled for his tablet, his stylus. Agamemnon waited until he was ready.

"My dearest Clytemnestra," he began. His voice was steady. "Joyful news. The young hero Achilles, son of Peleus, has asked for our daughter's hand in marriage. I have consented. Bring Iphigenia to Aulis immediately—the wedding must take place before we sail. Make all haste. I long to see our daughter wed to the greatest warrior of his generation."

He paused. The scribe's stylus scratched on wax.

"Sign it with my seal. Send it with the fastest rider we have."

"Yes, my lord." The scribe hesitated. "Is that all?"

"That's all."

The man bowed and withdrew. Agamemnon sat in the dying light, listening to the silence.

It was done. The thing that could not be undone.

He felt—nothing. A strange emptiness where anguish should have been. Perhaps it would come later. Perhaps he would wake in the night, shaking, sick with what he'd chosen.

Or perhaps this was simply what kings were made of. The ability to do what must be done and feel nothing at all.

The lamp went out. Agamemnon sat in the darkness until dawn.

---

Odysseus noticed the change at breakfast.

Agamemnon emerged from his tent looking rested, purposeful. He spoke with his captains, reviewed supply manifests, gave orders with the crisp efficiency of a man who had solved a difficult problem.

Odysseus watched from across the camp, chewing bread he couldn't taste.

Something had shifted. Agamemnon had spent the last two weeks growing increasingly tense as the calm persisted, his temper fraying, his confidence eroding. This morning he looked like a man who knew exactly what was going to happen next.

Odysseus finished his bread. Walked a circuit of the camp, speaking to soldiers, gathering information. No one knew anything—or if they knew, they weren't saying.

He was returning to his own tents when he saw the rider.

A young man on a fast horse, riding south along the coast road. He wore the livery of Mycenae, and he rode like a man carrying urgent news.

South. Toward Mycenae. Toward Clytemnestra and the children.

Odysseus watched until the rider disappeared around the headland. Then he went back to his tent and tried very hard not to think about what message that rider might be carrying.

---

The beach at Aulis was grey in the pre-dawn light.

Achilles moved through sword forms, his blade cutting arcs through the salt air. He'd been here since before sunrise, as he was every morning—driven from sleep by something he couldn't name, compelled to move, to fight, to prepare.

The war would begin soon. He could feel it. The gods had promised him glory, and the gods did not lie.

Behind him, footsteps in the sand. He didn't turn.

"You know," Patroclus said, "other men sleep until the sun is actually up."

"Other men aren't Achilles."

"Other men aren't insufferable, either."

Achilles smiled without breaking his form. Thrust, parry, pivot, cut. The movements were as natural as breathing—had been since he was a child, training with Chiron on Mount Pelion. The centaur had taught him everything: how to hold a blade, how to read an opponent, how to kill quickly and how to kill slowly and when each was appropriate.

He finished the sequence and lowered his sword. Turned to face Patroclus.

His friend stood a few paces away, wrapped in a cloak against the morning chill. They had grown up together—Patroclus sent to Phthia as a boy after killing another child in a fight over dice, raised alongside Achilles as a companion, a sparring partner, something more than either of them had words for.

"You look terrible," Achilles said.

"I didn't sleep."

"Worried about the war?"

"Worried about you." Patroclus sat down on a rock, pulling his cloak tighter. "You've been out here every morning for two weeks. Training like the Trojans are going to swim across the sea and attack us tonight."

"I'm ready. I want to be ready."

"You've been ready since you were twelve." Patroclus studied him. "What are you really doing out here?"

Achilles didn't answer immediately. He looked out at the harbor, at the thousand ships sitting motionless on the glassy water.

"My mother told me," he said finally. "Before I left Phthia. She said I had a choice. Stay home, live a long life, die old and forgotten. Or sail to Troy, win glory that will last forever, and die young."

"I know. You've told me."

"I chose glory. I chose this." He turned back to Patroclus. "But sitting here, waiting, watching the sails hang limp—it doesn't feel like glory. It feels like rotting."

"The wind will come."

"Will it? It's been two weeks. The men are restless. The kings are talking about going home." Achilles drove his sword into the sand, leaned on the pommel. "What if this is all it is? What if I gave up a long life for nothing?"

Patroclus rose, crossed to him. Put a hand on his shoulder.

"The wind will come," he said again. "The gods want this war as much as you do. They've been setting it up for twenty years—Paris and the apple, Helen and the oath. You think they're going to let it fizzle out because of a little calm?"

Achilles looked at him. Something in his chest loosened, just slightly.

"When did you become a theologian?"

"When my best friend started moping on the beach at dawn." Patroclus squeezed his shoulder, let go. "Come on. I'll spar with you. Maybe if you hit me enough times, you'll feel better."

Achilles smiled. A real smile, this time.

"You're a good friend."

"I'm the best friend. Now pick up your sword before I change my mind."

---

The rider returned three days later. He went straight to Agamemnon's tent, didn't emerge for an hour.

When he did, he was carrying a new message. Riding north this time, toward the coast road.

Odysseus watched. He'd been watching for three days—tracking Agamemnon's movements, noting his conversations, trying to piece together the shape of whatever was being planned.

He'd failed. Agamemnon was careful, spoke only to his closest advisors, kept his secrets well. But the second rider told Odysseus something: whatever was coming, it was coming soon.

That afternoon, a council of kings. Agamemnon presided, calm and confident.

"The gods will provide," he said, when asked about the wind. "We must have faith."

"Faith doesn't fill sails," someone muttered. Diomedes, probably—the young king of Argos was never shy about speaking his mind.

"No. But patience does." Agamemnon smiled. "I've had word from the priests. The signs are favorable. We'll sail within the week."

Murmurs. Skepticism, but also hope. The men wanted to believe.

After the council broke, Odysseus approached Agamemnon.

"A word, my lord?"

Agamemnon turned, his expression pleasant. "Odysseus. What is it?"

"You seem confident about the wind."

"I am."

"May I ask why?"

"You may ask." Agamemnon's smile didn't waver. "Whether I answer is another matter."

Odysseus studied him. The high king's face was a mask—polished, impenetrable.

"The messenger," Odysseus said carefully. "The one who rode south three days ago. And the one who rode north this morning. Whatever you're planning, it involves Mycenae."

Agamemnon's expression flickered. Just for a moment.

"You're observant."

"It's my only talent."

"Hardly." Agamemnon turned, began walking toward his tent. Odysseus fell into step beside him. "The situation is being handled, Odysseus. That's all you need to know."

"Handled how?"

Agamemnon stopped. Turned to face him.

"Do you trust me?"

"I trust that you'll do what you believe is necessary."

"Then trust that, and ask no more questions." Agamemnon held his gaze. "Some knowledge is a burden. I'm sparing you that burden. You should thank me."

He walked away. Odysseus watched him go.

*Some knowledge is a burden.*

He thought about the riders. About Mycenae. About what was in Mycenae that might be worth sending for.

He thought about the sacrifice Calchas had demanded.

He thought about Agamemnon's daughter.

The sun beat down on the beach. The sails hung limp. The harbor was still as glass.

Odysseus walked back to his camp and said nothing to anyone.

---

The ship arrived on the fifth day.

Achilles was drilling with his Myrmidons when the cry went up—sails on the horizon. A single vessel, flying the colors of Mycenae.

He didn't think much of it. Ships came and went; messengers arrived daily with news from across Greece. He finished the drill, corrected a young soldier's footwork, dismissed the men for their midday meal.

He was washing the sweat from his face when Patroclus found him.

"You need to come with me."

Something in his voice. Achilles lowered the cloth, looked at him.

"What's wrong?"

"Just come."

They walked through the camp toward the harbor. Men were gathered on the shore, talking excitedly. As Achilles passed, some of them turned—and their faces did something strange. Smiles. Knowing looks. One man clapped him on the shoulder.

"Congratulations, prince!"

Achilles stopped. "For what?"

"The wedding, of course! A king's daughter—and Agamemnon's at that. You've done well for yourself."

Achilles looked at Patroclus.

"I don't know," Patroclus said, before he could ask. "I've heard the same rumors. Agamemnon told his wife that you asked for Iphigenia's hand. She's here. On that ship."

"That's insane. I've never met the girl. I never asked for anyone's hand."

"I know."

The crowd parted as they approached the shore. And there, stepping off the gangplank—

Clytemnestra, road-weary but regal, her face tight with some emotion Achilles couldn't read.

And beside her, a girl.

Fifteen, maybe sixteen. Dark hair. Wearing white—a bride's color.

She was looking around at the army with an expression of barely contained excitement. Her eyes were searching the crowd. Looking for someone.

Looking for him.

Achilles felt something cold move through his chest.

"She thinks she's here for a wedding," he said.

"Yes."

"She thinks she's going to marry me."

"Yes."

"But I never—" He stopped. His hands were shaking. "What is this? What is Agamemnon doing?"

Patroclus didn't answer. He didn't have to.

Achilles turned and walked toward the high king's tent.

---

The guards tried to stop him.

It was a mistake. Achilles went through them like a scythe through wheat—not killing, but close. He broke one man's arm, dislocated another's shoulder, left a third gasping in the dirt with the wind knocked out of him.

He burst through the tent flap.

Agamemnon was seated at his table, a cup of wine in his hand. He didn't rise. Didn't reach for a weapon. Just looked at Achilles with an expression of mild interest.

"Ah. I expected you sooner."

"What have you done?"

"Sit down."

"What have you *done*?"

"Sit. Down." Agamemnon's voice hardened. "Or I'll have you dragged out of here in chains. Don't think I won't."

Achilles stood in the entrance, breathing hard. His sword was in his hand—he didn't remember drawing it.

Behind Agamemnon, more guards had appeared. Six, eight, too many. And outside, the sounds of men running, shouts of alarm.

Achilles forced himself to breathe. Lowered his sword. Didn't sheathe it.

"Good." Agamemnon took a sip of wine. "Now we can talk like civilized men."

"There's a girl out there in a wedding dress. She thinks she's going to marry me."

"Yes."

"I never asked for her hand. I've never even met her."

"Also true."

"Then what—" Achilles stopped. Something in Agamemnon's face. Something in the calm, the patience, the absolute lack of guilt. "This isn't about a wedding, is it?"

"No."

"Then what is it about?"

Agamemnon set down his cup. "The wind won't blow. You've noticed. The priests say Artemis is angry—a sacred deer was killed, a grove was violated. She demands payment."

"What kind of payment?"

"A life." Agamemnon's voice was flat. "Royal blood. My daughter."

Silence. The tent seemed to contract, the air pressing close.

"You're going to kill her," Achilles said.

"The goddess will kill her. I'm merely the instrument."

"You used my name. You told her mother—told *her*—that I wanted to marry her. You brought her here with a lie."

"I brought her here quickly and quietly. If I'd told the truth, do you think she would have come? Do you think Clytemnestra would have permitted it?" Agamemnon shook his head. "The lie was necessary."

"Necessary." Achilles's grip tightened on his sword. "You borrowed my honor to lure a girl to her death."

"I used what I needed to use. The war requires it." Agamemnon rose, finally, and faced him. "Do you understand what happens if I refuse? The wind never blows. The army dissolves. Every king here goes home, and we never avenge the insult to Greece. Troy stands forever, laughing at us."

"Then let them laugh."

"Easy for you to say. You have nothing to lose." Agamemnon's voice sharpened. "You came here to die gloriously. What do you care if the war happens or not? You'll find another war. But I've staked everything on this—my reputation, my authority, the future of my house. I will not let it fail because a goddess demands blood and I'm too weak to pay."

Achilles stared at him. The high king's face was stone—not conflicted, not anguished. Certain.

"You're going to kill your own daughter."

"I'm going to save this expedition. I'm going to conquer Troy. I'm going to do what must be done." Agamemnon stepped closer. "Go back to your camp, boy. The sacrifice happens at dawn. The wind will blow. And you'll have your war, and your glory, and everything you came here for."

"And Iphigenia?"

"Will be remembered as the girl who saved Greece." Something flickered in Agamemnon's eyes—the only hint of feeling he'd shown. "That's more than most people get."

Achilles stood frozen. His sword arm was trembling with the need to move, to strike, to end this creature where he stood.

But the guards were watching. And beyond them, the whole army—Agamemnon's army. Achilles was one man. One man against a hundred thousand.

"If you do this," he said quietly, "I will never forget it."

"I'm counting on that." Agamemnon smiled. It didn't reach his eyes. "Grudges make men fight harder. Now get out of my tent."

Achilles left.

He didn't trust himself to stay.

---

Odysseus found him outside, pacing like a caged lion.

"Achilles—"

"Did you know?"

Odysseus stopped. "What?"

"Did you know what he was planning? The sacrifice. The lie." Achilles rounded on him. "You're the clever one. The one who sees everything. Did you know?"

Odysseus was quiet for a moment. "I suspected."

"You suspected."

"The riders to Mycenae. The sudden confidence about the wind. I put the pieces together."

"And you said nothing."

"What was I supposed to say? 'Excuse me, high king, I think you're planning to murder your daughter'?" Odysseus shook his head. "He would have denied it. Or killed me for knowing."

"So you kept quiet. You waited. And now a girl is going to die because you couldn't be bothered to—"

"To what?" Odysseus's voice sharpened. "Stop him? How? He's the high king. He has a hundred thousand men. Even if I'd told everyone what I suspected, do you think they would have believed me? Do you think they would have defied him?"

Achilles said nothing.

"This is war," Odysseus said, more quietly. "This is what war is. You came here looking for glory, for honor, for the kind of death the poets sing about. But first you have to get there. And getting there means—" He stopped. "It means things like this."

"Things like murdering children."

"Things like doing what must be done. What the gods require. What the mission requires." Odysseus looked away. "I don't like it any more than you do."

"But you'll watch it happen."

"Yes."

"And then you'll sail to Troy."

"Yes."

Achilles stared at him. Something shifted in his face—contempt, maybe, or disappointment.

"Is this what we are?" he asked. "Is this what all of you are? Kings and heroes who murder children and call it necessity?"

Odysseus didn't answer. He didn't have an answer.

Achilles walked away.

---

That night, Agamemnon went to his wife.

She was quartered in a smaller tent near his own, with Iphigenia in an adjoining chamber. When he entered, Clytemnestra was sitting by a lamp, still in her traveling clothes, her face unreadable.

"My lord." She didn't rise.

"There's been a change of plans."

"Has there."

"The wedding must be postponed. Achilles has—there are complications. Military matters." Agamemnon kept his voice casual. "You and Iphigenia will need to stay in camp tonight. Tomorrow, perhaps, we'll know more."

Clytemnestra studied him. Her eyes were dark, searching.

"Iphigenia spent the entire voyage preparing. Practicing her vows. Dreaming about her wedding night." Her voice was flat. "She's in there now, brushing her hair. She must have brushed it a hundred times since we arrived."

"These things happen. Delays are common in wartime."

"Are they."

Agamemnon met her gaze. Held it.

"Stay in your tent tonight. Both of you. I'll send word in the morning."

He turned to leave.

"Agamemnon."

He stopped.

"If something happens to my daughter—"

"Nothing will happen to your daughter." He said it easily, automatically. "She'll be fine. You'll both be fine."

He left before she could respond.

Behind him, in the tent, Clytemnestra sat very still. Her hands were folded in her lap. Her face revealed nothing.

But her eyes—her eyes were taking note. Storing. Remembering.

---

The Myrmidon camp was quiet.

Achilles sat outside his tent, staring at the stars. Patroclus sat beside him, their shoulders almost touching.

"I could stop it," Achilles said. "Take my men and—"

"And what? Fight the entire Greek army?"

"If I had to."

"You'd die. And the sacrifice would happen anyway." Patroclus's voice was gentle. "Agamemnon has a hundred thousand soldiers. You have fifty. The math doesn't work."

"Then I could kill him. Personally. Challenge him to single combat—"

"He'd refuse. Or have you arrested. Or killed in your sleep." Patroclus shook his head. "There's no version of this where you win, Achilles. The pieces have already been moved. The game is already over."

Achilles was silent.

"Is this what you expected?" he asked finally. "When we sailed from Phthia. Is this what you thought war would be?"

"I didn't think about it much. I just—I followed you. I've always followed you."

"Why?"

Patroclus was quiet for a moment. "Because you're the best thing in my life. Because when you're not around, everything is duller. Greyer." He glanced at Achilles. "Because I'd rather be here, watching something terrible happen, than be anywhere else without you."

Achilles looked at him. In the starlight, Patroclus's face was familiar and strange at once—the face he'd known since childhood, rearranged into something adult, something serious.

"I chose glory," Achilles said. "I chose an early death. My mother gave me the choice and I chose this. But I thought—" He stopped. "I thought it would be different. I thought glory would feel like something."

"It will. Eventually. Just not tonight."

"What does tonight feel like?"

Patroclus considered. "Like finding out that the gods are smaller than you thought. Like realizing that heroes are just men, and men are—"

"Monsters."

"I was going to say 'flawed.' But yes. Sometimes monsters."

Silence. The stars wheeled overhead.

"If I ever become like him," Achilles said. "Like Agamemnon. If I ever put necessity above honor, expedience above decency—"

"You won't."

"Promise me." Achilles turned to face him. "If I ever become that, kill me yourself. Don't let me live as something I'd be ashamed of."

Patroclus met his eyes. Something passed between them—old and deep and unspoken.

"I promise."

Achilles nodded. Turned back to the stars.

They sat together until dawn, not speaking, not sleeping.

Waiting for the thing that couldn't be stopped.

---

The altar had been built on a cliff overlooking the sea.

White stone, dragged up from the beach. Garlands of flowers, wilting in the morning heat. A fire already burning, its smoke rising straight up in the windless air.

The army gathered below—a sea of faces, bronze and leather, stretching back across the beach. They'd been told only that a sacrifice was required, that the gods demanded it. Most assumed it would be an animal. A bull, perhaps. A ram.

Odysseus stood at the back of the crowd.

He'd positioned himself as far from the altar as possible, half-hidden behind a supply wagon. He told himself it was because the view was fine from here, that he didn't need to be closer.

He knew it was cowardice. He didn't care.

The priests came first. Calchas at their head, his white robes bright against the grey stone. They arranged themselves around the altar, chanting something in a language Odysseus didn't recognize.

Then Agamemnon.

He climbed the path alone, his face set like marble. He wore armor—ceremonial, polished to a mirror shine. He looked like a king. He looked like a statue of a king, something carved and cold and inhuman.

Then—

Odysseus's chest tightened.

Iphigenia.

She climbed the path between two priests, her white dress trailing on the stones. Her hair was loose, freshly brushed, gleaming in the morning light. Her face was confused, uncertain—she kept glancing around, looking for something.

Looking for Achilles, Odysseus realized. She still thought this was her wedding.

Behind her, at the base of the cliff, a commotion. Clytemnestra trying to push through the crowd, guards holding her back. Her voice carried over the assembly—not words, just sound, raw and desperate.

Iphigenia heard. Turned. Saw her mother struggling, saw the guards, saw the expressions on the faces around her.

Understanding came slowly. Odysseus watched it move across her face like a shadow—confusion, then doubt, then dawning horror.

"Father?"

Agamemnon didn't answer. He nodded to the priests.

They took her arms.

She screamed. The sound cut through the morning air, sharp and thin, the scream of a child who has just realized that the world is not what she thought it was.

"Father! Father, please—"

One of the priests produced a cloth. Gagged her. The screaming stopped, replaced by muffled sounds that were somehow worse.

Clytemnestra broke through the guards. She made it three steps up the path before more men caught her, dragged her back. Her screaming didn't stop—wordless now, animal.

Iphigenia was at the altar. The priests held her down, her white dress spread across the stone, her eyes wide and terrified above the gag.

Agamemnon picked up the knife.

Odysseus closed his eyes.

He heard Clytemnestra's screaming. He heard the priests' chanting, rising in pitch. He heard the crackle of the fire and the murmur of the crowd and the distant cry of gulls.

He heard silence.

Then—

Wind.

It came from nowhere, sudden and strong, roaring across the beach. Tents snapped and billowed. Banners cracked like whips. The sails—the thousand sails that had hung limp for weeks—filled with a sound like thunder.

The men cheered. The army that had been restless and doubtful moments before now shouted in triumph, raising their spears, praising the gods.

Odysseus opened his eyes.

The altar was red. The priests were backing away, their robes spattered. Agamemnon stood with the knife still in his hand, his face unreadable.

On the stones below, Clytemnestra had stopped screaming. The guards had released her, and she knelt in the dirt, staring up at the altar, her face slack and empty.

Not empty, Odysseus realized. Transformed. Something had been alive in her, and now it was dead. Something else had taken its place.

She met Agamemnon's eyes across the distance. Her lips moved. No sound came out.

But Odysseus could read them. Could read the promise forming there.

*I will remember this.*

The wind howled. The sails filled. The fleet was ready to sail.

Odysseus turned away from the altar and walked back to his ship.

---

Agamemnon washed his hands in a basin.

The water turned red, then pink, then clear. He watched it swirl down the drain, watched the last traces of his daughter disappear.

He thought about Troy. About the wind filling the sails. About the army that was finally, finally ready to move.

He thought: *It worked.*

He reached for a cloth. Dried his hands. Examined them—clean, steady, no tremor.

Outside, his captains were shouting orders. Ships were being loaded. The machinery of war was lurching into motion.

He would board his flagship within the hour. By nightfall, they would be at sea. By this time next year, Troy would be burning.

He didn't think about Iphigenia's face. He didn't think about Clytemnestra's scream.

He thought about victory.

He thought about glory.

He walked out of his tent and began giving orders.

---

The Myrmidons were breaking camp.

Achilles moved among them, checking equipment, giving commands, his face blank. The men gave him space—they'd heard the rumors, seen his fury, knew that something terrible had happened on that altar.

Patroclus found him near the ships.

"Time to board."

"I know."

They stood together, watching the last of the tents come down.

"I didn't watch," Achilles said. "I couldn't."

"Neither did I."

"But I could hear." Achilles's voice was hollow. "Her screaming. Muffled, like they'd gagged her, but I could still hear it. And then—nothing. This terrible silence. I was standing behind the supply tents, as far as I could get, and I could still hear the knife." He swallowed. "The sound it made. And then the wind came, right after, like the gods were thanking him."

Patroclus said nothing.

"Is that what the gods want? Is that what glory costs?" Achilles turned to him. "She was fifteen. She walked up that path thinking she was going to be married. And they—"

His voice broke.

Patroclus put a hand on his arm. Squeezed.

"I'm never going to be like them," Achilles said. "Never. No matter what happens. No matter what this war costs me."

"I know."

"I mean it."

"I know you do."

Achilles took a breath. Let it out slowly.

"Time to board," he said.

They walked to the ship. The gangplank was rough under their feet. The deck was crowded with men and equipment.

Achilles took his position at the prow. The sail filled above him, snapping taut in the wind that had cost a girl's life.

He didn't look back at the shore. Didn't look at the altar, still visible on the cliff, its stones stained dark.

He looked forward. Toward the horizon. Toward Troy.

*This is what I chose*, he thought. *This is what it costs.*

The ship pulled away from the beach. The fleet began to move.

---

Odysseus stood at the prow of his vessel, watching Aulis shrink behind them.

The altar was just visible on the cliff—a dark smudge against the morning sky. Already the priests would be cleaning the stones, scrubbing away the evidence. By tomorrow, there would be nothing left. Just another altar on another cliff.

But the gods would remember. The gods always remembered.

He thought about Iphigenia walking up the path in her white dress. About Clytemnestra's face when she understood.

He thought about Agamemnon washing his hands, his expression calm, already thinking about the next thing.

He thought about himself, standing at the back of the crowd, watching, saying nothing, doing nothing.

*The first blood of this war was Greek*, he thought. *And it was a child's.*

The wind pushed at his back, strong and steady. The sails strained. The fleet spread out across the water, a thousand ships sailing toward the same horizon.

Troy was out there, somewhere. Waiting.

Behind them, Aulis was already invisible. The altar, the cliff, the place where a girl had died—swallowed by distance and spray.

The war had begun.

It had cost them something already. Something they would never get back.

Odysseus turned away from the stern. Faced forward. Tried not to think about what else this war would cost before it was over.

The wind blew. The sails filled. The ships sailed east.
