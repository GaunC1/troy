## HECTOR

Hector had been on the walls since before the light came.

He couldn't sleep. Hadn't been able to for days, not properly. So he came here instead, to the eastern battlement where he could watch the horizon and pretend he was doing something useful.

Polydamas found him there, as he always did. His second-in-command was a practical man, uncomfortable with silence, and he filled it with logistics.

"The granaries are at capacity. If we seal the outer stores, we can last eighteen months without resupply. Twenty if we ration early."

"Ration early, then."

"The men won't like it."

"The men will like starving less."

Polydamas grunted. He leaned against the parapet, looking out at the dark sea. "You really think they're coming? Could be rumors. Could be—"

He stopped talking.

Hector turned to see what had silenced him.

The horizon was changing. A shape where there shouldn't be a shape. Then another. Then a third.

"Gods," Polydamas breathed.

Sails. Emerging from the morning haze like ghosts taking form. One became ten. Ten became fifty. Fifty became a hundred, and still they kept coming, the horizon filling with them, mast after mast after mast.

Behind them, footsteps. A young watchman, running for the alarm bell.

"Wait." Hector's voice was calm.

The boy stopped. "My lord—the fleet—"

"I see it."

"Should I sound the alarm? Wake the—"

"Not yet." Hector turned back to the horizon. The sails kept multiplying, spreading across the sea like a stain. "Let them sleep another hour. It's the last good sleep they'll have."

Polydamas was counting under his breath. He lost track, started over, lost track again.

"How many?" Hector asked.

"I can't—there's too many. Hundreds. Maybe a thousand."

A thousand ships. Hector let the number settle into him. A thousand ships, each carrying fifty men, maybe more. Fifty thousand soldiers. Maybe a hundred thousand.

"Get my brother," he said. "The real one. Tell him to arm himself and meet me at the lower gate."

"And Paris?"

Hector's jaw tightened. "Paris can do what Paris does. It doesn't matter now."

Polydamas hurried away. Hector stayed on the wall, watching the fleet approach.

Footsteps behind him. He knew them without turning.

"I told you to stay with Astyanax."

Andromache came to stand beside him. Her face was pale in the grey light, but her voice was steady. "The nurses are with him. He's sleeping." She looked at the horizon, at the sails still multiplying. "I needed to see."

"Now you've seen. Go back."

"In a moment." She watched the fleet in silence. "How many?"

"Too many to count."

"Then we count what we can save." She touched his arm—briefly, a wife's gesture, a soldier's farewell. "Come home tonight. Whatever happens. He should see his father's face before—" She stopped.

Before the siege closes in. Before the world shrinks to the space inside these walls.

"I'll come home," Hector said. "Now go."

Andromache went. She did not look back at the fleet. She had seen enough.

---

Hector stayed on the wall alone.

He had prepared for this. Drilled the men, stockpiled supplies, reinforced the gates. He had done everything a commander could do.

Now he would find out if it was enough.

---

## AGAMEMNON

On the flagship, Agamemnon stood at the head of the table.

The map was rough—coastline, walls, the beach where they would land. Wooden markers represented the contingents: Ajax, Diomedes, Odysseus, the Myrmidons.

"Ajax takes the left flank." Agamemnon moved a marker. "Diomedes holds the center with his chariots. Achilles—" He looked at the empty seat.

The other kings didn't look at each other.

Agamemnon moved the marker anyway. "—takes the beach first. As always."

His voice was flat. Everyone knew Achilles would do what Achilles did, orders or not. But the ritual of command had to be observed.

"Questions?" Silence. "Then go to your ships. We land within the hour."

The kings filed out. Agamemnon stayed at the table, studying the map, the markers, the walls he would break or die trying.

---

## ACHILLES

Achilles stood at the prow, watching the coastline sharpen into focus.

Patroclus found him there, still in his sleeping tunic, two pieces of bread in his hand. He held one out.

"You should eat something."

"After."

"You always say that. Then 'after' becomes 'tomorrow,' and then you're fighting on an empty stomach and wondering why your arms are shaking."

Achilles didn't take the bread. He pointed to the dark mass emerging from the mist. "There it is."

Patroclus looked. The walls of Troy, high and pale in the dawn light. The towers. The great gate, still closed.

"Smaller than I expected," he said.

"The walls aren't small."

"No. But the city is." Patroclus took a bite of bread, chewing slowly. "All this for that."

Achilles didn't respond. He was staring at the walls.

"What are you thinking?"

"My mother said I'd know. When I saw it. The place where I'm going to die."

Patroclus stopped chewing. "And?"

"And I know."

The ship lurched as it hit a sandbar, then pushed through. Around them, the Myrmidons were pulling on armor, checking straps, speaking in the low voices men used before battle.

"Achilles—"

But Achilles was already moving to the rail, his spear in his hand, his eyes on the beach where the Trojans were forming up.

The hull scraped sand. Achilles vaulted over before it stopped moving.

Patroclus watched him splash through the shallows, already running toward the enemy, not looking back.

He set down the bread and reached for his own armor.

---

The first three died before they knew he was there.

Achilles moved through the surf like something that belonged to it—water, blood, bronze, all the same. The Trojans scattered, reformed, scattered again. Bodies marked his path up the beach.

He paused at the tideline. The battle roared around him, but for a moment he was still.

He looked back at the ships.

Patroclus stood at the prow of theirs, watching. The distance between them—a hundred yards, maybe more—felt like nothing. Felt like everything.

Achilles held the look for a breath. Then he turned toward the walls without waving.

There was work to do.

---

## HECTOR

"Hold the line! Archers, concentrate on the landing zones!"

Hector's voice cut through the chaos of the beach. Arrows darkened the sky, falling among the Greeks splashing through the surf. Men screamed, fell, were trampled by the men behind them.

For a few minutes, it worked. The Trojans were organized, rested, fighting on familiar ground. The Greeks were cramped from weeks at sea, stumbling in the knee-deep water, easy targets for the archers on the bluffs.

"Chariots?" His captain, Polydamas, was at his elbow.

"Not yet. Hold them in reserve."

"The left flank is buckling."

"Reinforce it. Pull men from the center."

"That'll weaken—"

"I know what it'll do. Do it anyway."

Polydamas ran to deliver the order. Hector watched the left flank, counting heartbeats, calculating distances. If the Greeks broke through there, they'd have a clear path to the bluffs. If they reached the bluffs—

A runner appeared, breathless, wild-eyed.

"My lord—the center—"

"What about it?"

"There's a man. He's—you have to see."

Hector pushed through the chaos toward the center of the line. Past wounded men being dragged to the rear, past soldiers shouting for more arrows, past a boy sitting in the sand staring at the place where his hand used to be.

He reached the front. Stopped.

A circle had formed in the midst of the fighting. Trojans on one side, shields raised, not advancing. In the center of the circle, surrounded by bodies—

A single Greek warrior.

---

## PARIS

Paris saw the boy before the boy saw him.

Greek. Young—maybe sixteen, maybe less. He was stumbling through the surf, his sword held in front of him like a torch to ward off darkness. His eyes were wide and terrified and looking everywhere at once.

*He's someone's son,* Paris thought. *Someone's brother. He sailed across the sea because of what I did.*

The boy saw him.

For a moment, neither of them moved. The battle roared around them—screams, the clash of bronze, arrows hissing overhead—but in this small space, this accidental circle, there was only the two of them.

The boy raised his sword. It was trembling.

Paris had a spear. He had the advantage—longer reach, better footing. All he had to do was thrust. One clean motion, the way Hector had taught him.

He couldn't move.

His arms wouldn't respond. His legs were rooted to the sand. He could see the boy coming toward him, could see the fear hardening into something that might pass for courage, could see the sword rising—

*Move,* he told himself. *Thrust. Dodge. Do something.*

But all he could think was: *He's here because of me. He's going to die because of me. Or I'm going to kill him because of me.*

The sword came down.

Paris flinched backward, tripped, fell. The sand was wet and cold against his back. The boy stood over him, confused by how easy this was, adjusting his grip for the killing blow—

A bronze blur. Hector's spear, appearing from nowhere, catching the boy in the side. The boy made a sound—surprised, almost—and crumpled.

Hands grabbed Paris. Hauled him up. Hector's face, close to his, twisted with something that might have been rage or fear or both.

"Move. Now."

Paris moved. His body was shaking so badly he could barely stand, but he moved. Hector shoved him toward a chariot, toward old Euchenor who was fighting to control the horses.

"Get him out of here," Hector said. "Now."

The chariot lurched forward. Paris grabbed the rail, held on, watched the battle recede behind him. Watched Hector turn back toward the fighting, toward the single Greek warrior who was cutting through men like they were made of straw.

*I couldn't do it,* Paris thought. *I couldn't even—*

The thought wouldn't complete itself. His hands wouldn't stop shaking.

---

## HECTOR

Hector was back at the center of the line when he saw him clearly.

Bronze armor, a horsehair plume, a spear that dripped red. He stood among the dead like a man standing in a garden, relaxed, unhurried. His chest rose and fell slowly. He wasn't even breathing hard.

As Hector watched, a Trojan soldier broke from the line and rushed him—a brave man, or a stupid one. The Greek moved. It was hard to see exactly what he did; he was just *there*, and then the Trojan was falling, and the spear was dripping again.

"Who is that?" someone whispered.

Hector didn't answer. He already knew.

The Greek turned, scanning the Trojan line, looking for the next opponent. His gaze swept across the shields, the spears, the frightened faces—

And stopped on Hector.

Their eyes met.

The noise of battle faded. The screaming, the clash of bronze, the hiss of arrows—all of it distant, muffled. There was only this: two men, seeing each other across a field of bodies.

The Greek smiled. It was not a friendly expression.

*This is the man.*

A Trojan archer loosed an arrow. It struck the Greek's helmet with a sound like a hammer on an anvil and glanced away. The Greek didn't flinch. He just turned, slowly, toward the archer.

"Fall back!" Hector's voice came out harder than he intended. "Everyone fall back! Retreat to the gates!"

---

The retreat was chaos.

Men running, stumbling, trampling each other in their rush to reach the walls. The Greek—Achilles, it had to be Achilles—cutting through anyone too slow to escape. The Myrmidons following in his wake, efficient and silent, finishing what their leader started.

Hector grabbed men as they passed, shoved them toward the gates, screamed orders that no one followed. The line had broken. All he could do now was save what he could.

"Close the gates! Close the—"

"My lord!"

A chariot was pushing through the rout, against the flow. Old Euchenor at the reins, fighting to control the horses. And in the chariot, still clinging to the rail—

Paris.

His brother's face was white. His armor was still spotless. His sword was still sheathed.

"Why are you still here?" Hector grabbed the chariot rail. "I told you to get him out!"

"The gates were blocked, my lord." Euchenor's voice was strained. "We've been circling, trying to find a way through."

Paris opened his mouth. Nothing came out.

"Get him inside. Now. Before the Greeks reach the gates."

The chariot pushed on toward the gates. Paris didn't look back.

Hector stayed until the last of the stragglers had passed, until the Greek advance was close enough that he could see individual faces. Then he turned and ran for the gates himself, and they swung shut behind him with a sound like a tomb closing.

---

The walls held.

The first wave hit the gates like a fist against stone. Hector watched from the battlements as Greek soldiers swarmed the base of the walls, their shields raised against the arrows raining down. The gates shuddered. Bronze rang on bronze. Men screamed—some in rage, some in pain as boiling oil found the gaps in their armor.

A soldier with a rope and grappling hook sprinted toward the wall. He threw. The hook scraped against the stone twenty feet below the top and clattered back down. He threw again. Same result. An arrow took him in the throat before he could try a third time.

The walls rose forty feet. Smooth limestone, fitted without mortar, the joints too tight for fingers or blades. Below, Greeks died trying to climb them—boosting each other onto shoulders, clawing at the stone, sliding back down in heaps of tangled limbs.

The second wave brought logs. Fifty men shouldered a cedar trunk and charged the gates. The impact echoed across the plain. The gates groaned. Held. The Greeks pulled back, charged again. Above them, Trojans hurled stones the size of a man's head. Bodies crumpled. The log fell. Men stumbled over their own dead to retrieve it.

Then a horn sounded from the beach. The Greeks hesitated. The horn again—three sharp blasts. They pulled back, dragging their wounded, leaving their dead where they lay.

No siege towers. No battering rams. Just men with swords and spears, looking up at walls they couldn't climb.

Hector stood on the battlements, watching them retreat to the beach. Watching them begin to set up camp.

"Six hundred dead." Polydamas, at his elbow. "Maybe more. We're still counting."

"Wounded?"

"Twice that. Maybe three times."

"The gates?"

"Holding. No structural damage."

Hector nodded. It could have been worse. It should have been worse. If not for the walls—

"They're settling in," Polydamas said. "Look. They're digging fortifications."

"They know they can't storm the walls. So they'll starve us out."

"We have supplies for—"

"I know what we have." Hector turned away from the Greek camp. "Double the watch. I want patrols on the walls all night. And find my brother."

"Which one?"

"Paris."

Polydamas hesitated. "My lord, maybe it would be better to—"

"Find him."

---

## PARIS

Paris was in his chambers, sitting on the edge of his bed, still in his armor.

He hadn't moved since the servants brought him back from the gates. Helen had come, had asked if he was hurt, had tried to help him remove the breastplate. He'd pushed her away. Gently, but away.

She was in the corner now, her hands still at her sides, watching him with those eyes that saw too much.

"Paris." Her voice was soft. "You should eat something."

"I'm not hungry."

"You should still—"

"I said I'm not hungry."

Helen's hands moved to the clasp of his armor, working it loose despite his refusal. She had learned to be useful with her hands. It was better than being still.

Silence.

Paris looked at his hands. They weren't shaking anymore, at least. They'd been shaking for an hour after the gates closed.

"I froze," he said.

Helen didn't respond.

"There was a Greek. A boy. Younger than me, probably. He was scared—I could see it, the way his sword was trembling. And I had a spear. I had the advantage. All I had to do was thrust."

"But you didn't."

"I couldn't." Paris turned his hands over, examining the palms. "I kept thinking—he's someone's son. Someone's brother. He sailed across the sea because of us, and now I'm supposed to kill him for it. And I just... couldn't."

"That's not weakness."

"Yes it is." Paris looked up at her. "In a war, that's the only thing it can be."

There was a knock at the door. A servant's voice: "My lord. Prince Hector is here."

Paris stood. Straightened his armor. Nodded to the servant.

Hector entered. He looked at Paris, at Helen, at the untouched food on the table.

"Leave us," he said to Helen.

She looked at Paris. He nodded. She left.

The brothers stood in silence. Hector walked to the window, looked out at the city below.

"They're calling it a victory," he said finally. "The people. They're saying we held the walls, drove back the Greeks. They're celebrating in the streets."

"That's good."

"Is it?" Hector turned. "Six hundred dead. I counted. The scribes are still writing down the names."

Paris said nothing.

"You froze. A Greek boy—fifteen, maybe sixteen—had his sword at your throat. You just stood there."

"Yes."

"I pulled three men off the eastern line to get you out. The eastern line broke two minutes later. Forty men died in the gap."

Paris's face went white.

"Euchenor couldn't get you through the gates. You circled for ten minutes while the retreat was collapsing. I saw the chariot. I thought you were dead."

Silence.

"I'm—"

"Polydamas has the casualty lists. You can read the names yourself."

Silence.

"I'll do better," Paris said. "I'll train harder. I'll—"

"You'll stay off the field."

"What?"

"You heard me. You're no use out there. You're worse than no use—you're a liability. Men will die trying to protect you." Hector moved toward the door. "Stay in the palace. Play with your bow. Leave the fighting to people who can do it."

"Hector—"

His brother stopped at the door, but didn't turn.

"I started this," Paris said. "Let me help finish it."

"You can't finish it. That's the point." Hector opened the door. "You started something you can't finish. Now the rest of us have to live with it."

He left.

Paris stood alone in his chambers, his spotless armor still strapped to his chest, his unbloodied sword still sheathed at his hip.

---

## ACHILLES

The Myrmidon camp was at the north end of the beach, away from the main Greek force.

Achilles sat on a rock, cleaning his spear by torchlight. The blood came off easily if you got to it before it dried. He'd learned that years ago.

Patroclus found him there.

"The kings are meeting. Agamemnon wants to plan the siege."

"Let them plan."

"He asked for you specifically."

"Then he can keep asking."

Patroclus sat down beside him. They watched the waves for a while, the foam catching the torchlight.

"Seventeen," Patroclus said.

"What?"

"I counted. Seventeen men. That's what you killed during the landing."

Achilles held the spear up, checking for spots he'd missed. "Is that all?"

"It felt like more. Watching."

"It always feels like more. Watching."

He found a spot of dried blood near the base of the blade, worked at it with his cloth. Patroclus waited.

"You saw their commander," Patroclus said finally.

"Yes."

"The one they call Hector."

"Yes."

"What did you think?"

Achilles set down the spear. Looked at the distant walls, dark shapes against the stars.

"I thought he was smart. The retreat—he saved half his army. Another commander would have lost everyone." He paused. "I thought he was scared."

"Of losing?"

"Of me."

Patroclus absorbed this. "And that pleased you?"

"No." Achilles picked up the spear again. "It disappointed me. I was hoping for more."

"More?"

"More... fight. More fire. He looked at me and I could see him calculating. Measuring. Deciding I was too dangerous to engage." Achilles shook his head. "That's smart. But it's not what I want."

"What do you want?"

"Someone who looks at me and doesn't calculate. Someone who just comes." He thrust the spear into the sand, watched it quiver. "Someone worth killing. I thought Hector might be that. The way they talk about him—defender of Troy, beloved of his people. I thought when he saw me, he'd feel what I felt. The pull. The necessity." Achilles stared at the distant walls. "Instead he calculated. Like everyone else."

Patroclus was quiet for a moment. Then: "That's a strange thing to want."

"I'm a strange person."

"No. You're a simple person with strange desires." Patroclus stood, brushed sand from his tunic. "The kings will be angry that you didn't come."

"Let them be angry."

"Agamemnon."

"Agamemnon can choke on his anger. He's not my king."

Patroclus sighed. "You're going to make this war very difficult."

"I'm going to make this war short."

Achilles pulled the spear from the sand, held it up to the torchlight. The bronze gleamed, clean and ready.

"Tomorrow," he said. "We'll hit them again tomorrow. Before they've had time to organize."

"The walls—"

"Will fall. Eventually. Everything falls, Patroclus. That's the only thing I know for certain."

---

## PRIAM

The war council met at dawn on the second day.

The generals argued. Some wanted sorties—quick strikes to disrupt the Greek camp. Others urged patience—let the walls do the work. Voices rose, fell, tangled together.

Priam listened.

Finally he raised his hand. Silence fell.

"We defend," he said. "No sorties. No attacks. We let them break themselves on our walls."

Hector started to object. "Father, if we strike while they're still organizing—"

"This is my decision." Priam's voice was quiet, but it carried. "Our walls have never fallen. Theirs are made of sand. We wait."

The generals exchanged glances. Some nodded. Others looked at Hector, waiting for him to argue.

He didn't. He was the crown prince, not the king. Not yet.

The door opened.

Cassandra entered the chamber. The generals tensed, expecting hysteria—the wild eyes, the fragments of prophecy no one could understand.

Instead she spoke quietly, evenly.

"Their supply depot at Tenedos is poorly guarded. Strike now and their siege breaks within the month."

The room went still. Priam's jaw tightened.

Polydamas cleared his throat. "Princess, perhaps we should consider—"

Priam raised his hand again. "Thank you, Cassandra. You may go."

She stood there a moment longer, her eyes moving from face to face. Looking for one that might listen. Finding none.

She left without raising her voice.

The generals resumed their debate. Within minutes, no one mentioned Tenedos.

---

## PARIS

The challenge came on the third day.

A Greek herald, alone, walking across the no-man's-land between the camps with a staff of truce. The Trojans watched him come, arrows nocked but not drawn.

He stopped before the gates and spoke in a voice trained to carry:

"Menelaus, King of Sparta, challenges Paris of Troy to single combat. The victor takes Helen. The loser's army withdraws in peace. Let one death end what one theft began."

The words echoed off the walls. Above, on the battlements, faces appeared—soldiers, servants, anyone who could find a vantage point.

The great hall was cold despite the braziers. Morning light fell through the high windows in pale shafts, catching the dust that rose from the stone floor. The council had been arguing for an hour.

Paris stood near the back, by a column, where no one had to look at him.

"It's a trap," someone was saying. "Menelaus was one of the finest warriors in Greece. He trained under—"

"We should refuse," another voice cut in. "Why risk—"

"If we refuse, we look like cowards. The other cities will—"

"Better to look like cowards than to hand him victory on a—"

"ENOUGH."

Priam's voice silenced the room. The old king sat on his throne, a wool blanket across his knees despite the braziers. His spotted hands gripped the armrests.

"We know the risks. We know the stakes. What we need is a decision." His gaze found Hector near the wall. "What do you recommend?"

Hector stood with his arms crossed, his jaw tight. He was looking at the floor. "Menelaus is dangerous. Skilled, experienced, motivated by rage." A long pause. "But Paris is fast. And he's motivated too."

Somewhere in the back, someone shifted their weight. A captain near the door cleared his throat.

"One fight could end this. The terms are fair."

"So we accept," Priam said. He slowly turned to look at Paris, squinting. "Paris. Come forward."

The council parted around him. His sandals dragged loudly on the stone. General Antenor scratched at his beard, eyes on the window.  A servant by the door rearranged cups on a tray, turning each one slightly, then turning it back.

Paris stopped before the throne.

"You understand what you're agreeing to?" Priam asked. "Single combat. If you lose, Helen goes back. The gold goes back. The war ends."

"I understand."

"Can you beat him?"

Paris thought about the beach. The Greek boy with the trembling sword. His own frozen limbs.

"He's angry," Paris said. "Angry men make mistakes." He kept his voice steady. "And I'm faster than I look."

Priam nodded slowly. Behind Paris, a chair scraped against stone. Someone coughed.

"This could end the war," Paris said. "One fight. If I win, we have peace."

"Yes." Priam's voice was warm. "If you win, we have peace."

"I started this. Let me finish it."

Priam studied him. Then he rose from the throne—slowly, his knees stiff—and descended the steps. The council watched in silence.

He stopped before Paris and put his hands on his son's shoulders. Up close, Paris could see the lines around his father's eyes, the grey in his beard. Priam's fingers pressed into the muscle, firm and steady.

"My son," Priam said, loud enough for the room to hear. "Champion of Troy."

Paris's throat tightened. He nodded.

Priam pulled him into an embrace. His arms wrapped around Paris, held him close. Paris could feel his father's heart beating against his chest.

"I'm proud of you," Priam whispered, so only Paris could hear.

When they parted, Priam's eyes were bright. He blinked twice, quickly, and turned back to the council.

"Send word to the Greeks. Tomorrow at dawn. Single combat." He sat back on the throne, pulling the blanket over his knees. "My son will end this war."

The council murmured approval. Hector nodded once, then glanced at Paris. A servant appeared at Paris's elbow with wine. He took it. His hands were steady.

---

## HELEN

Helen found Paris on the walls.

He was looking at the Greek camp, at the fires spread across the beach like fallen stars. He didn't turn when she approached.

"You don't have to do this," she said.

"Yes I do."

"You could refuse. We could leave—slip out in the night, take a ship to Egypt, to—"

"And let the war continue? Let men keep dying because I was too afraid to face the consequences of what I did?"

Helen was quiet.

"I'm not brave," Paris said. "You know that. Everyone knows that." He finally turned to look at her. "But maybe this is something different. Maybe this isn't about being brave. Maybe it's just about being responsible."

"You'll die."

"Probably."

"Is that what you want? To die for me?"

"I don't want to die at all." He almost smiled. "But I want to live as a coward even less."

Helen stepped closer. Put her hand on his chest, over his heart.

"I never asked for this," she said. "For any of it. You know that."

"I know."

"I don't want you to die for me. I don't want anyone to die for me."

"I know." He covered her hand with his. "But I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it because I started this. And tomorrow I'm going to finish it."

They stood together in the darkness, her hand on his heart, his hand on hers.

Below, the Greek fires burned.

Tomorrow, one way or another, this would be over.

---

Later, in the dark, she reached for him.

Not speaking. Not needing to. His hands learning her, her breath catching at each discovery. They'd had so little time—a few months, a stolen voyage, a war already at the gates. And still this. The heat, the urgency, the way the world narrowed to skin and breath and nothing else.

After, she lay with her head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat slow.

"Stay," she whispered. "Don't go down there tomorrow. We'll slip out tonight—take a ship to Egypt, to—"

"Helen."

"I know." Her voice broke. "I know you have to. I just—"

He pulled her closer. His hand moved through her hair, slow and steady.

"After," he said. "When this is done. We'll have the rest of our lives."

She pressed her face against his throat and breathed him in. She didn't say what she was thinking: that there might not be an after. That tomorrow she might watch him die, and then the ships would come for her, and Menelaus would be waiting.

She didn't know what frightened her more—losing Paris, or finding out what she'd feel when she saw her husband's face again.

She held him tighter instead.

---

## HELEN

Helen stood on the walls with the other women of the court.

A guard gestured to her cushioned seat—the one they'd brought for her, the one that marked her as wife of a prince. She remained standing at the parapet's edge.

"My lady, please—"

"I'll watch from here."

Priam glanced at her from his position nearby. She met his gaze, did not move. After a moment, he waved the guard away.

Below, on the plain, the armies were forming. The circle of white stones. The killing floor.

Helen watched. She did not blink. She did not look away.

---

## PARIS

The field was marked with white stones: a circle, twenty paces across.

Paris walked toward it alone.

His armor was the best Troy had—bronze plates over leather, a helmet with a horsehair crest, a shield bearing the emblem of his house. His sword was sharp, his spear straight, his body as ready as training could make it.

None of it would be enough.

The Trojan army lined the walls, watching. The Greek army spread across the beach, waiting. Between them, the circle. The killing floor.

Menelaus emerged from the Greek lines.

He looked different than Paris remembered. Older, harder, the softness of Spartan court life burned away by months of rage. He moved with the easy confidence of a man who had done this many times before—who had killed many times before—and expected to do it again.

They met at the edge of the circle. Close enough to speak, if there was anything to say.

Menelaus looked at him. The expression on his face was strange—not hatred, not rage, but something almost like pity.

"You're younger than I expected," he said.

Paris didn't respond.

"She talked about you, you know. After you left. She said you were kind. That you listened." Menelaus's voice was flat. "I tried to be kind. I tried to listen. It wasn't enough."

"I'm sorry."

"No you're not." Menelaus raised his shield. "But you will be."

The horn sounded.

Menelaus came forward fast—faster than Paris expected. The first blow caught his shield before he was ready, drove him back a step. Paris's eyes flicked to the gap between them—five paces, four, three. His sword arm dropped a fraction, his body trying to create distance that didn't exist in sword range. The second blow came while he was still backing up, a thrust at his midsection that he barely deflected.

Paris tried to counter. His spear swept toward Menelaus's legs—a move Hector had taught him, designed to force an opponent off balance. Menelaus stepped over it like a man stepping over a puddle and brought his sword down toward Paris's head.

Paris got his shield up. The impact numbed his arm.

He stumbled back—always back, always seeking the space between them that Menelaus wouldn't give him. Menelaus followed, relentless, each blow coming before Paris could recover from the last. The spear was too slow, too clumsy; Paris dropped it, grabbed for his sword.

Menelaus kicked him in the chest.

Paris hit the ground hard. The air left his lungs. He saw the sky, bright and blue, wheeling above him.

*This is it,* he thought. *This is how it ends.*

Just the sky, impossibly blue, and the taste of blood in his mouth.

*I'm sorry,* he thought. *I'm sorry I wasn't worth any of this.*

Menelaus stood over him, breathing hard now, his sword raised.

"This is what she left me for?" His voice cracked. "This?"

Paris tried to speak. Nothing came out.

The sword began to fall.

And then—

A horn. Three sharp blasts.

Menelaus hesitated, half-turned toward the sound.

The Trojan lines were moving. Soldiers surging forward, breaking formation, shields raised. Someone was screaming orders—or maybe just screaming.

"What—" Menelaus spun, saw the advance, turned back to Paris—

But Paris was already moving. His body acted without his mind, rolling away, scrambling to his feet, running. He lost his sword in the dirt, lost his shield, lost everything except the desperate need to reach the Trojan lines.

Behind him, Menelaus screamed.

On the walls, the women of the court gasped and looked away. Helen leaned forward. Watched every moment of his retreat—the stumbling run, the soldiers grabbing him, the desperate scramble toward the gates. Her face showed nothing.

Arrows fell around them—not aimed, just cover fire, archers loosing at anything that moved. Menelaus had to fall back or die. He chose to fall back.

Hands grabbed Paris. Trojan hands, pulling him behind shields, dragging him toward the gates. He couldn't stand—his legs wouldn't work—so they carried him, hauled him like a sack of grain through the chaos.

The gates opened, swallowed him, slammed shut.

Paris lay on the stones of the courtyard, staring up at the sky, his body shaking so hard his teeth rattled.

He was alive.

He didn't understand how, but he was alive.

## HECTOR

"Who gave the order?"

Hector's voice was cold. He stood in the gatehouse, surrounded by captains, his hands clenched at his sides.

"I don't know, my lord." Polydamas looked shaken. "The horns sounded, and the men moved. I thought—I thought you had ordered it."

"I didn't order anything. We were supposed to honor the truce."

"Someone sounded the charge. I don't know who."

Hector turned to another captain. "You. Did you see who blew the horns?"

"No, my lord. It happened too fast."

"And you?"

"No, my lord."

"Someone gave that order." Hector looked at each of them in turn.

Silence. The captains looked at each other, at the floor, at anywhere except Hector's face.

"My lord." Polydamas's voice was careful. "Some of the men are saying... they're saying they saw something. On the field. A mist, or a light. They're saying the goddess—"

"The goddess." Hector's voice was flat.

"Aphrodite. They're saying she intervened. That she saved Paris, like she promised she would."

Hector turned away. Walked to the window. Below, in the courtyard, Paris was being helped to his feet, servants rushing to attend him.

"It wasn't a goddess," Hector said quietly. "It was someone with a horn and poor judgment. But we'll never find them now. Everyone will believe what they want to believe."

"My lord—"

"The war continues. The duel settled nothing. Paris is alive, and men will keep dying, and we're no closer to ending this than we were this morning." Hector didn't turn around. "Get the men back on the walls. Double the watch tonight. The Greeks will be angry."

"Yes, my lord."

The captains filed out. Hector stood at the window, watching his brother being led toward the palace.

He would probably never know who gave that order.

## ACHILLES

The Greek camp was in chaos.

Achilles watched from a distance as kings shouted at each other, as soldiers milled in confusion, as Menelaus—returned from the field, cheated of his kill—screamed at anyone who came near him.

"They broke the truce," Agamemnon was saying. "They—"

"Did they?" Odysseus, calm as always, stood apart from the shouting. "I couldn't see who gave the order. Could anyone?"

"Does it matter? Paris escaped. The duel—"

"The duel is void. Neither side can claim victory." Odysseus shrugged. "We're back where we started."

"Then we attack. Now. Their lines were—"

"Their lines are behind walls now. The moment's passed."

Achilles walked away from the argument. He'd heard enough.

Patroclus fell into step beside him.

"You wanted Paris dead," Patroclus said.

"I wanted it over."

"Would you have accepted that? Going home without your glory?"

Achilles didn't answer. They walked in silence toward the Myrmidon camp.

"Someone gave that order," Patroclus said. "Someone on their side decided to break the truce."

"Yes."

"Why?"

"To save Paris. To keep the war going. To—" Achilles stopped. Looked back at the distant walls. "I don't know. Maybe they had a reason. Maybe they panicked. Maybe a god whispered in someone's ear."

"You believe that? Gods whispering?"

"I believe something happened that doesn't make sense. I believe Paris should be dead, and he isn't." Achilles started walking again. "What I call that doesn't matter. What matters is the war continues."

"And your glory?"

"My glory continues too." Achilles smiled, but there was no warmth in it. "Hector is still alive. The walls are still standing. There's still work to do."

## PARIS

Night fell over Troy.

Paris sat in his chambers, cleaned and bandaged and dressed in soft clothes. Helen had tended his wounds—a cut on his arm, bruises on his chest, nothing serious. Nothing that matched what should have happened.

"I don't remember," he said. "After I fell. It's just... blank. I was on the ground, and Menelaus was standing over me, and then I was running. I don't remember deciding to run."

Helen said nothing.

"They're saying Aphrodite saved me. That the goddess intervened." Paris looked at his hands. "Maybe she did. I don't know. I don't know what happened."

She said nothing.

A knock at the door. Paris knew who it was before the servant announced him.

"Let him in."

Hector entered. He looked at Paris, at Helen, at the bandages.

"Leave us," he said.

Helen looked at Paris. He nodded. She left.

The brothers faced each other.

"Someone broke the truce," Hector said. "Someone gave the order to charge. I don't know who."

"Aphrodite—"

"It wasn't a goddess." Hector's voice was sharp. "It was a man with a horn. A man who decided your life was worth more than the truce, more than the chance to end this war. A man I can't find and probably never will."

"I didn't ask—"

"I know you didn't ask. That's not the point." Hector moved to the window, looked out at the darkened city. "The point is you should be dead. The war should be over. Helen should be on a ship back to Sparta, and our men would be standing down, and in a few months this would all be a bad memory."

"I'm sorry."

"Stop apologizing." Hector turned to face him. "Apologies don't bring back the dead. Apologies don't end wars. Apologies are just sounds you make so you don't have to actually do anything."

Paris said nothing.

"You wanted to fix this. To make up for what you did." Hector's voice softened, just slightly. "I saw that. On the field, when you accepted the challenge. You were trying."

"It wasn't enough."

"No. It wasn't." Hector moved toward the door. "But it was something. For what it's worth—I didn't expect that from you."

He left.

---

Later, when the palace slept, Paris found a courtyard.

A smaller courtyard near the stables, where no one came at night. He'd brought his bow. The one thing he was good at, the one skill that had never mattered in a war of spears and swords.

He set a torch at the far end. Forty paces. Then he walked back, nocked an arrow, and drew.

The first shot went wide. The second clipped the wall. The third found the mark—not the torch itself, but close enough to make the flame dance.

He fired again. And again. His fingers found their rhythm, the string biting into the calluses he'd built over years of practice. When the torch finally guttered and died, he retrieved his arrows and set another.

Fifty paces this time.

His arms ached. His fingers bled where the calluses had worn through. He kept shooting.

Above, at a window he never noticed, Helen watched him in the darkness. She stayed until he was done, then returned to their empty bed.

Paris didn't come back until dawn.

## HECTOR

The walls were quiet.

Hector walked alone, past the watchfires, past the guards who nodded and said nothing. He didn't want to sleep—couldn't sleep—so he walked.

He stopped at the eastern battlement, the place where he'd stood three days ago watching the fleet arrive. A lifetime ago.

---

## CASSANDRA

In her tower, Cassandra felt it.

A pull. Bronze and salt. The smell of a man standing too long in one place.

She went to the window. Found him on the eastern battlement—a shape against the Greek fires. His hands on the stone. His weight forward, leaning into wind.

Three weeks ago, in this same spot, she had said *kill him* and watched Hector's face change. A flicker. His hand had moved toward his sword. Then the flicker died, and he looked at her the way they all looked at her, and walked away.

She was already moving. Down the stairs. Through the corridors. Out onto the walls.

---

Footsteps behind him. Light, careful.

He knew without turning. "Cassandra."

His sister came to stand beside him. She looked thinner than he remembered, paler.

"What do you see?" he asked.

She didn't answer immediately. Her eyes were fixed on the Greek fires, but he knew she wasn't seeing them. She was seeing something else. Something that hadn't happened yet.

"Smoke," she said finally. "But not from their fires."

"What does that mean?"

She turned to look at him. Her eyes were dark, empty.

"There's a horse. But it's not a horse. It's full of teeth."

"Cassandra—"

"And the baby. Your baby." Her voice was distant, dreamy. "He's flying. But not like a bird."

Hector felt something cold touch his spine. "What baby? What are you talking about?"

For a moment—just a moment—something flickered at the edge of his mind. A memory that wasn't quite a memory. He'd heard this before. Not these exact words, but this feeling, this dread. Cassandra's face in firelight, her hands gripping his arms, her voice saying something about walls and his son and—

It slipped away.

He shook his head. "Cassandra—"

But she was looking past him now, at something he couldn't see.

"How long?" he asked. "How long does this war last?"

She blinked. Came back to herself, slowly, like a diver surfacing.

"Long enough," she said, "for the children who aren't born yet to pick up swords."

She walked away before he could respond. Her footsteps faded into the darkness.

Hector stood alone on the walls, her words hanging in the air.

*A horse that's not a horse. Full of teeth.*

*The baby flying. But not like a bird.*

*Children who aren't born yet picking up swords.*

He didn't understand. He wasn't sure he wanted to understand.

Below, the Greek fires burned. The siege had begun.

The war would continue.
