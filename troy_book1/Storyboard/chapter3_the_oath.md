## Summary
The chapter opens with Odysseus living a peaceful domestic life on Ithaca, building a stone wall and tending to his family. A Mycenaean ship arrives with news that the oath has been invoked: all who swore to defend Helen's husband must now sail to war against Troy. Meanwhile, Agamemnon informs his family of the coming war and privately reveals his true ambition - not to recover Helen, but to conquer Troy and its strategic trade routes.

In Troy, Cassandra experiences visions of the Greek mobilization and attempts one final time to warn her father Priam and the court about the coming destruction. When her warnings are dismissed yet again, she makes a pivotal decision: she will stop trying to change what cannot be changed and simply bear witness to the doom. Helen follows her into the corridor and expresses belief in Cassandra's visions, and Cassandra shares a disturbing prophecy about a young girl who will be sacrificed before the ships sail.

Odysseus attempts to evade the oath by feigning madness, plowing a beach with mismatched animals and sowing salt. Palamedes exposes the deception by placing baby Telemachus in the path of the plow, forcing Odysseus to swerve and reveal his sanity. Odysseus vows to one day kill Palamedes for this. The Greek kings gather at Aulis with the largest army ever assembled - a thousand ships and ninety thousand men. But after the council, the wind dies and refuses to return. The priest Calchas reveals that Artemis demands a sacrifice: Agamemnon's daughter Iphigenia. The chapter ends with Agamemnon standing alone, contemplating this impossible choice.

## Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1 - Odysseus on Ithaca (Odysseus POV):**
Odysseus works on a stone wall with old Eurylochus while Penelope sits nearby with baby Telemachus. They discuss simple matters - the wall, a spotted ram, the modest economics of Ithaca. A servant announces a ship from Mycenae. Odysseus knows what it means and walks to the harbor without looking back.

**Scene 2 - Agamemnon's Family Dinner (Agamemnon POV):**
Agamemnon announces to his family that Helen has been stolen and the oath is invoked. Iphigenia asks innocent questions about the war. Agamemnon promises he'll be "perfectly safe" with a thousand ships. Clytemnestra watches with guarded eyes and reveals nothing, but her hands are steady while her eyes are not.

**Scene 3 - Cassandra's Vision (Cassandra POV):**
Cassandra wakes from a vision showing roads across Greece, riders carrying messages, harbors filling with ships. She whispers "They're coming. All of them."

**Scene 4 - The Messengers on Ithaca (Odysseus POV):**
The Mycenaean messengers formally invoke the oath and list the kingdoms that have answered, including Phthia (Achilles). Odysseus learns Agamemnon will lead. Penelope reminds him he created this oath; he admits he thought it would protect them. He says he'll "think of something."

**Scene 5 - Odysseus's Feigned Madness Begins (Odysseus POV):**
For three days, Penelope tells the messengers Odysseus has taken ill with fever and madness. Most messengers are convinced, but Palamedes insists they wait.

**Scene 6 - Cassandra's Vision of the Plow (Cassandra POV):**
Cassandra sees a vision of a man plowing salt into sand on a grey beach, watched by men on dunes. She sees the sharp-faced man (Palamedes) take a baby from a woman's arms. She doesn't understand but watches until dawn.

**Scene 7 - Agamemnon's Private Ambitions (Agamemnon POV):**
Alone, Agamemnon studies a map of Troy, revealing his true motivation: control of trade routes and the glory of conquest. Iphigenia visits, unable to sleep, and asks about Achilles. Agamemnon considers her marriageable value and promises she'll meet Achilles. He sits thinking about Troy, wind, ships, and "the things men did to get what they wanted."

**Scene 8 - The Plow and the Baby (Odysseus POV):**
Odysseus plows the beach with a donkey and ox, scattering salt, muttering nonsense. Palamedes takes Telemachus from Penelope and places him in the path of the plow. Odysseus swerves at the last moment, revealing his sanity. Palamedes declares victory. Odysseus, with cold fury, tells Penelope to remember Palamedes's name: "Because one day I'm going to kill him."

**Scene 9 - Cassandra in the Throne Room (Cassandra POV):**
Cassandra warns Priam and the court about the thousand ships and the coming destruction. Priam dismisses her concerns, trusting in Troy's walls and diplomacy. She confronts Paris with rage. Hector says he's reinforcing walls and stockpiling grain. Helen follows Cassandra into the corridor and says she believes her. Cassandra shares a vision of a young girl in white who will be sacrificed. Alone in her chambers, Cassandra decides to stop warning them - she will only watch from now on.

**Scene 10 - Aulis Assembly (Agamemnon POV):**
Agamemnon surveys the gathered fleet: over a thousand ships, perhaps ninety thousand men. Odysseus has arrived with twelve Ithacan ships. Agamemnon calls for a council of all kings.

**Scene 11 - Odysseus at Aulis (Odysseus POV):**
Odysseus walks among his Ithacan men, wondering how many will return home. Palamedes approaches with false pleasantries and mentions "no hard feelings." Odysseus gives minimal responses, his face blank but his eyes revealing otherwise.

**Scene 12 - The War Council (Odysseus POV):**
Agamemnon addresses the kings, framing the war as about Greek sovereignty, not Helen. He promises they will "burn the city that dared to steal" from them. Odysseus watches without cheering, recognizing that Agamemnon "would do anything to win this war."

**Scene 13 - The Wind Dies (Agamemnon POV):**
The fleet is becalmed for weeks. Tensions rise; fights break out. The priest Calchas reveals Artemis is angry about a violated sacred grove during a hunt at Sparta. The goddess demands a sacrifice: Iphigenia. Agamemnon orders silence and stands alone, facing the still sea.

## Key Moments
- Odysseus leaves his peaceful domestic life on Ithaca without looking back
- Agamemnon's promise to Iphigenia that she'll meet Achilles (tragic foreshadowing)
- Clytemnestra's controlled reaction to the war announcement - her hands steady, her eyes not
- Palamedes placing baby Telemachus in front of the plow to expose Odysseus's deception
- Odysseus's cold vow to kill Palamedes - said like stating the weather
- Cassandra's decision to stop warning and simply bear witness
- Helen telling Cassandra "I believe you"
- Cassandra's prophecy about the girl in white who will be sacrificed
- Agamemnon's private reflection on "the things men did to get what they wanted"
- Calchas's demand for Iphigenia's sacrifice to appease Artemis
- The ironic connection: Agamemnon promised Iphigenia she'd meet Achilles, and this may become the lie that brings her to her death

## Chapter End
The chapter ends with Agamemnon standing alone at the entrance of his tent. Behind him waits the largest army in history, immobilized by divine displeasure. Before him stretches the flat, silver, windless sea. He has just learned that the only way to launch his war is to sacrifice his own daughter. He orders Calchas to tell no one while he "thinks" - but the chapter leaves the decision hanging, the reader knowing from Cassandra's vision that the girl in white will walk to her death.
