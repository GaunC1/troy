## Summary
The wind refuses to blow at Aulis, stranding the Greek fleet. Agamemnon, faced with the impossible choice demanded by the goddess Artemis, decides to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to appease the gods. He sends a false letter to Clytemnestra claiming that Achilles has asked for Iphigenia's hand in marriage, luring the girl to Aulis under the pretense of a wedding.

When Iphigenia arrives in her white bridal dress, Achilles discovers his name has been used to bring her to her death. He confronts Agamemnon in fury but is powerless to stop the sacrifice. Odysseus, who suspected the plan but said nothing, watches from the edges. That night, Clytemnestra confronts her husband, sensing his deception, and makes a veiled promise of future vengeance.

At dawn, Iphigenia is led to the altar still believing she will be married. When she realizes the truth, she is gagged and held down. Agamemnon kills her himself. The wind immediately rises, the sails fill, and the fleet prepares to sail. As the Greeks depart Aulis, each character grapples with the moral cost of what has been done. Cassandra in Troy experiences the sacrifice through a vision. The chapter ends with the fleet sailing east toward Troy, the war having already extracted its first terrible price.

## Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1 - Agamemnon (opening):** In his tent at night, Agamemnon weighs his options. He examines a pale blue ribbon Iphigenia gave him as a child, then sets it aside. He dictates a false letter to his wife claiming Achilles wants to marry Iphigenia, instructing her to bring their daughter to Aulis immediately. He sits in darkness until dawn.

**Scene 2 - Odysseus:** Odysseus notices Agamemnon's transformation from anxious to confident. He sees a rider in Mycenaean livery heading south and begins to suspect something is being planned involving Mycenae.

**Scene 3 - Achilles:** On the beach at dawn, Achilles trains obsessively. Patroclus joins him. Achilles confesses his fear that the stalled fleet means his choice of glory over a long life may have been for nothing. Patroclus reassures him. They spar together.

**Scene 4 - Odysseus:** Three days later, a second rider returns from Mycenae. At a council, Agamemnon confidently predicts they will sail within a week. Odysseus confronts him privately about the messengers; Agamemnon deflects, warning that "some knowledge is a burden." Odysseus pieces together that the sacrifice will involve Agamemnon's daughter.

**Scene 5 - Achilles:** A ship arrives carrying Clytemnestra and Iphigenia. Soldiers congratulate Achilles on his upcoming wedding. He is bewildered, then horrified when Patroclus explains. He sees Iphigenia in a white bridal dress, searching the crowd for him.

**Scene 6 - Achilles confronts Agamemnon:** Achilles fights through guards to reach Agamemnon's tent. Agamemnon calmly explains the sacrifice: Artemis demands Iphigenia's life for the wind. He justifies using Achilles's name as necessary expedience. Achilles threatens never to forget; Agamemnon says "Grudges make men fight harder."

**Scene 7 - Odysseus and Achilles:** Outside, Odysseus admits he suspected but did nothing. Achilles accuses him of cowardice. Odysseus defends himself with pragmatism: "This is what war is." Achilles walks away, asking if all the kings are monsters who murder children and call it necessity.

**Scene 8 - Agamemnon visits Clytemnestra and Iphigenia:** That night, Agamemnon tells his wife there's been a "delay." Iphigenia appears, excited about her wedding, asking if Achilles is kind. Agamemnon memorizes her face. Clytemnestra sees through his lies and delivers a chilling promise: if anything happens to Iphigenia, she will spend the rest of her life making him pay, waiting twenty years if necessary.

**Scene 9 - Achilles and Patroclus at night:** Achilles considers fighting to save her but Patroclus explains the math doesn't work. They discuss what war really is. Achilles makes Patroclus promise to kill him if he ever becomes like Agamemnon. They sit together until dawn.

**Scene 10 - The Sacrifice (Odysseus POV):** At the altar on the cliff, Odysseus watches from the back of the crowd. Iphigenia climbs the path still thinking it's her wedding. Clytemnestra tries to break through guards. Iphigenia realizes the truth and screams. She is gagged and held down. Agamemnon takes the knife. Odysseus closes his eyes.

**Scene 11 - Cassandra's Vision:** In Troy, Cassandra experiences the sacrifice through a violent vision. She feels the knife, the tearing, the "price paid in the wrong currency." She knows the girl's name and that the wind is rising. The ships will sail.

**Scene 12 - The Wind Comes:** The wind rises immediately after the sacrifice. The army cheers. Clytemnestra, released by guards, kneels in the dirt and makes a silent promise: "I will remember this." Odysseus turns away.

**Scene 13 - Agamemnon:** Agamemnon washes his daughter's blood from his hands. He thinks only of victory and glory. He walks out and begins giving orders.

**Scene 14 - Achilles Departs:** Achilles boards his ship with Patroclus. He didn't watch but heard the gagged screaming and the silence. He vows never to become like them. He takes his position at the prow, looking toward Troy.

**Scene 15 - Odysseus Departs (closing):** Odysseus watches Aulis shrink behind them. He catalogs what he's learned about Agamemnon. He tries not to think about what else this war will cost. The fleet sails east.
