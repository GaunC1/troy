# Chapter 1: "The Apple"

## POVs
1. Paris
2. Cassandra
3. Helen
4. Cassandra (return)

## Summary
The chapter opens on Mount Ida where Paris, a shepherd unaware of his royal lineage, is visited by the goddesses Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite. They demand he judge which of them is "the fairest" and award a golden apple. Each offers a bribe: Athena promises military glory, Hera promises political power, and Aphrodite promises the love of Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world. Paris chooses Aphrodite. When he asks if he will destroy Troy as his mother's prophecy foretold, Athena replies: "You already have." Paris abandons his flock and walks toward Troy to reclaim his birthright.

In Troy, Cassandra wakes from a prophetic vision of fire and destruction, now layered with a new image: a shepherd, three figures of light, an apple changing hands. She sees Paris descending the mountain and warns the guards to kill him before he enters the city. They dismiss her as mad. When Hector visits later, she begs him to kill Paris, describing in detail the fall of Troy and the death of his son Astyanax. For a moment Hector believes her, but Apollo's curse takes hold and he forgets, leaving with gentle condescension.

Six months later in Sparta, Paris attends a diplomatic feast at the court of Menelaus. When Helen and Paris lock eyes across the table, something passes between them. Helen spills her wine, goes pale, and cannot stop trembling. Across the sea, Cassandra experiences a vision of this moment, seeing the golden thread of fate binding Paris and Helen together, stretching back to wrap around Troy's towers.
