# Chapter 2: "The Theft"

## POVs
1. Paris
2. Helen
3. Hector
4. Cassandra (brief)

## Summary
Paris and Helen meet secretly in the palace garden during his diplomatic visit to Sparta. Paris reveals his origins as the abandoned prince raised by shepherds; Helen confides her emotional numbness, her childhood abduction, and her hollow marriage. Over the following days, with Menelaus away on a hunting trip, a quiet attraction builds between them through stolen glances, brief conversations, and small gifts.

On the final night before the Trojan ship departs, Paris asks Helen to come with him to Troy. She visits her sleeping daughter Hermione one last time, then walks to the harbor at dawn. There she witnesses Aeneas overseeing the loading of stolen treasure from Sparta's treasury and realizes this is not merely a romantic escape but a calculated theft. She boards the ship anyway.

In Troy, Hector receives news of the abduction and the stolen gold. He recognizes this will mean war: every Greek king bound by the suitor's oath will come for Helen. He reflects on Cassandra's earlier warning to kill Paris, a warning he could not hold onto because of her curse. When Paris's ship arrives, Troy celebrates while Hector watches in despair, knowing their doom is sealed. Cassandra observes from her tower, and when Helen looks up at her, their eyes meet across the distance in an unsettling moment of recognition.

## Scene Breakdown

### Paris - Garden Meeting (Night)
Paris, unable to sleep, wanders the palace and finds Helen sitting alone at a fountain. They share intimate conversation: he tells her about being abandoned as an infant due to prophecy and raised by shepherds for twenty years; she reveals her childhood abduction, her emotional deadness, and how she has been "performing" her entire life. A connection forms. Helen leaves, thanking him for not pretending.

### Paris - The Invitation (Five Days Later)
Menelaus has departed on a hunting trip. Paris finds Helen on the walls overlooking the harbor on the night before his ship departs. He asks her to come with him to Troy, acknowledging he is asking her to leave everything. She cannot answer. He tells her the ship name (*Aedon*) and departure time (first light), then walks away without looking back.

### Helen - Menelaus Departs
Helen watches her husband prepare for the boar hunt, noting his genuine happiness at the prospect. He asks her to manage the guests and compliments her for being "lively" with Paris. She watches him ride away with the hunting party.

### Helen - The Days Between
A montage of growing attraction: glances across the courtyard, whispered conversations, watching Paris practice swordwork, a small shell pressed into her palm. Helen feels herself waking from a long sleep. She lies awake the night before the ship leaves, feeling her careful life beginning to crack.

### Helen - Hermione's Chamber
After midnight, Helen visits her sleeping nine-year-old daughter. She acknowledges she has not been a good mother, has felt nothing for the girl. She almost touches Hermione's hair, considers what staying versus leaving would mean, then walks out without looking back.

### Helen - The Departure
Helen moves through the dark city to the harbor. At the *Aedon*, she sees Aeneas directing sailors loading iron-banded chests from Sparta's treasury. She realizes this is a theft of wealth, not just of her. Aeneas sees her watching; his expression does not change. She boards anyway. Paris takes her hand. The ship departs at sunrise. She watches Sparta vanish without looking back.

### Hector - The News
Hector is training soldiers in the practice yard when a messenger arrives with news from Sparta: the queen is gone, the treasury emptied, Paris is responsible. Hector reads the message twice, shows no emotion, and continues his duties.

### Hector - On the Walls (Dawn)
Andromache finds Hector where she left him; he has not slept. They discuss the situation. Hector explains returning Helen would not be enough because Paris also stole the gold, humiliating Menelaus. He reveals the suitor's oath that binds every Greek king to defend Helen's husband. He estimates they have perhaps a year before a thousand ships and a hundred thousand men arrive. He admits he wanted to kill Paris, and that Cassandra had begged him to do so three weeks before, but he could not hold onto her words due to her curse. Andromache subtly touches her stomach, hinting at pregnancy.

### Hector - The Arrival
The ship arrives at midday. The crowd celebrates, unaware of what this means. Hector watches from the walls as the stolen chests are unloaded and Paris descends with Helen. A boy tugs at Helen's dress. Hector turns away, unable to watch, knowing they are all committed to the doom Paris has brought.

### Cassandra - The Golden Thread
Cassandra watches from her tower window as Helen arrives. She sees the "golden thread" from her earlier vision now made flesh. Across the harbor, Helen looks up and their eyes meet. Cassandra feels it "like a blade between her ribs." Helen's face changes, then Paris draws her attention away. The celebration continues into the night.
