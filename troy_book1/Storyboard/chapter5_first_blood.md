# Chapter 5: "First Blood"

## POVs
1. Hector
2. Achilles
3. Paris
4. Cassandra (brief)

## Summary
The Greek fleet arrives at Troy in a massive armada of over a thousand ships. Hector watches from the walls as the horizon fills with sails, then leads the Trojan defense on the beach. The initial battle goes poorly for the Greeks who struggle through the surf, but Achilles proves unstoppable, cutting through Trojan soldiers and forcing Hector to order a retreat behind the walls. Paris freezes during combat and must be rescued by Hector, deepening the tension between the brothers.

Three days later, Menelaus challenges Paris to single combat to decide the war. Despite knowing he will lose, Paris accepts out of a sense of responsibility for the deaths his actions have caused. During the duel, Menelaus quickly overpowers Paris and is about to deliver the killing blow when an unauthorized horn sounds the Trojan charge, breaking the truce and saving Paris's life. The chapter ends with the siege officially begun, the duel's outcome nullified, and Cassandra delivering cryptic prophecies to Hector about a horse full of teeth and his baby flying.

## Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1 - Hector on the walls at dawn:**
Hector watches from the eastern battlement as the Greek fleet appears on the horizon. Polydamas reports on supplies (18-20 months with rationing). The fleet grows from one ship to hundreds, then a thousand. Andromache briefly joins him; they share a quiet farewell before the battle.

**Scene 2 - Achilles approaches Troy:**
Achilles stands at the prow watching the coastline. Patroclus tries to get him to eat. Achilles tells Patroclus he knows this is the place where he will die, confirming his mother's prophecy. He leaps from the ship before it stops, racing toward the enemy.

**Scene 3 - Beach battle, Hector's command:**
Hector directs the defense. Archers target the landing zones effectively at first. A runner arrives to tell him about a single Greek warrior cutting through the center.

**Scene 4 - Paris freezes in combat:**
Paris encounters a young, terrified Greek soldier. Despite having the advantage with his spear, Paris cannot bring himself to kill. The Greek boy is about to kill Paris when Hector intervenes, killing the boy and ordering Paris evacuated.

**Scene 5 - Hector sees Achilles:**
Hector reaches the center to find Achilles standing among the dead, barely winded. A Trojan soldier charges and is killed effortlessly. Hector and Achilles lock eyes across the battlefield. An arrow bounces off Achilles' helmet. Hector orders a full retreat.

**Scene 6 - The retreat:**
Chaos as Trojans flee to the gates. Paris is brought back by chariot; Euchenor confirms he froze. The gates close. The Greeks assault the walls twice but are repelled. Polydamas reports 600 dead, 1200-1800 wounded.

**Scene 7 - Hector confronts Paris:**
Hector finds Paris in his chambers with Helen. He berates Paris for freezing, for the 600 dead, for needing rescue. He orders Paris to stay off the battlefield, calling him a liability. Paris cannot defend himself.

**Scene 8 - Achilles in camp:**
Achilles cleans his spear at the Myrmidon camp, separate from the main Greek force. Patroclus tells him Agamemnon wants him at the kings' council; Achilles refuses. He expresses disappointment that Hector calculated and retreated rather than fighting him directly. He plans to attack again tomorrow.

**Scene 9 - Menelaus's challenge:**
On the third day, a Greek herald offers single combat: Menelaus vs. Paris, winner takes Helen, loser's army withdraws. The Trojan council debates. Hector flatly states Paris will lose. Paris steps forward and accepts anyway, acknowledging he will probably die but feeling he must take responsibility.

**Scene 10 - Priam and Paris:**
Priam calls Paris to him privately. He admits he exposed Paris on a mountain as an infant because of the prophecy. Now he is both proud and ashamed. Paris apologizes for everything. Priam accepts the duel.

**Scene 11 - Paris and Helen the night before:**
Paris looks at the Greek fires from the walls. Helen tries to convince him to refuse or flee. He insists he must face consequences. They share an intimate moment; he says he is dying because of his choices, not for her.

**Scene 12 - The duel:**
Paris walks onto the field in the best Trojan armor. Menelaus approaches, noting Paris is younger than expected. The horn sounds. Menelaus overwhelms Paris quickly. Paris drops his spear, gets kicked to the ground. He lies staring at the sky, tasting blood, waiting to die.

**Scene 13 - The truce breaks:**
Three horn blasts sound from the Trojan lines. Soldiers charge, breaking formation. Arrows provide cover fire. Paris rolls away, runs for the Trojan lines without his weapons. The gates swallow him. He lies shaking on the courtyard stones, alive but not understanding how.

**Scene 14 - Hector investigates:**
Hector demands to know who gave the order to charge. No one knows. Some claim they saw mist or light, saying Aphrodite intervened. Hector believes it was a man with a horn and poor judgment, but knows he will never find them. The war continues.

**Scene 15 - Greek camp reaction:**
Odysseus notes the duel is void and neither side can claim victory. Menelaus screams in rage. Achilles walks away from the arguing kings. He tells Patroclus he wanted it over, but now his glory continues. Hector and the walls still stand.

**Scene 16 - Paris after the duel:**
Paris sits bandaged in his chambers with Helen. He does not remember what happened after he fell. They discuss whether Aphrodite saved him. Hector arrives, tells Paris bluntly it was a man with a horn, not a goddess. He acknowledges Paris tried to make amends, even if it was not enough.

**Scene 17 - Cassandra's prophecy:**
Hector walks the walls alone at night. Cassandra finds him. She speaks of smoke not from the Greek fires, a horse full of teeth, and his baby flying "but not like a bird." She says the war will last long enough for unborn children to pick up swords. Hector almost grasps the meaning before it slips away.
