## Summary

Five years into the siege of Troy, the Greek army faces a supply crisis. At a contentious council meeting, Odysseus proposes raiding the coastal villages that supply Troy rather than waiting for delayed supply ships. Agamemnon agrees and assigns Achilles to lead the raid. Meanwhile, in Troy, Helen struggles with her guilt while working at the healing house and visiting Cassandra in her tower, where the prophetess speaks cryptically of "the horse" and "teeth."

Achilles leads a devastating night raid on a Trojan village, killing farmers and civilians while taking grain and captives. Hector rides out with cavalry but arrives too late; he finds the village destroyed and carries the body of a dead girl back to Troy. The sight of his sleeping son Astyanax contrasted with the dead child he carried devastates him. Upon the raiders' return, Achilles confides to Odysseus his growing disgust at what he has become, recalling a promise Patroclus made to kill him if he ever became like Agamemnon.

The chapter ends with parallel scenes of grief and resignation: Paris and Helen confronting their guilt, Hector and Andromache facing the reality of endless war, and Cassandra watching from the walls, seeing visions of the wooden horse that will one day bring Troy's destruction. The siege continues, with no end in sight.

**Scene 2 - Agamemnon Alone:** After the council empties, Agamemnon takes out a pale blue ribbon given to him by Iphigenia. He reflects on sacrificing his daughter five years ago, concluding coldly that he would do it again. He walks the camp and overhears soldiers talking about missing their families.

**Scene 3 - Odysseus and Achilles:** Odysseus finds Achilles preparing for the raid. Achilles expresses his frustration at five years of waiting, saying he will take any action over continued stagnation.

**Scene 4 - Helen and Paris in the Morning:** Helen wakes to Paris's touch. After intimacy, she insists on going to the healing house despite his pleas to stay. She refuses to hide from the war she caused.

**Scene 12 - The Raiders Return:** Odysseus watches the ships return loaded with grain and captives. Achilles stands apart, disturbed. He tells Odysseus about killing a boy with a fishing spear, and recalls Patroclus's promise to kill him if he ever became like Agamemnon.

**Scene 15 - Hector and Andromache:** Hector returns to their chambers after walking the walls all night. Andromache tells him the girl's grandmother was found. They discuss Cassandra's prophecy that the war will last until children not yet born can hold swords. They comfort each other and go to bed.

**Scene 16 - Odysseus at Dawn:** Odysseus stands at the water's edge, watching the sunrise. He reflects that progress is being made, inch by inch. A supply ship finally arrives. He turns back to work.
