## BRISEIS

Epistrophus arrived while they were still eating.

"You're up early," Briseis said. Her younger brother stood in the doorway, still in his sleeping tunic, hair flattened on one side. "I thought you had the late watch."

"Traded with Cleon." He crossed to the table and reached for the bread. "There's a merchant from Miletus at the market. Syrian glass, the good kind with the blue threading."

Mynes looked up from his porridge. "Glass? We're at war."

"The merchant doesn't care. Neither does the glass." Epistrophus shoved bread in his mouth, speaking around it. "Besides, the war's on the coast. We're fine."

"Pedasus was fine," Briseis said. "Thebe was fine."

The table went quiet.

Epistrophus stopped chewing. Mynes set down his spoon. Through the window, Briseis could see the courtyard—clay pots, drying herbs, three chickens pecking at the dust.

"Bri." Mynes's voice was careful. "We've talked about this."

"We haven't. You keep telling me not to worry, and I keep telling you the Greeks are working inland, and nothing changes."

"Lyrnessus has walls."

"Pedasus had walls. They're rubble now."

"Pedasus is on a river. The Greeks need water access for their ships. We're two days from—"

"From what? Safety? Is that what you think two days buys us?"

Epistrophus looked between them, bread still in his hand. "Should I—"

"The walls have held for a hundred years," Mynes said.

"Against who? Bandits? Pirates?" Briseis pushed back from the table. "This is Achilles. He took Thebe in a morning. Your walls won't hold against Achilles."

"My walls."

"You know what I mean."

Mynes went still—the quietness that was worse than shouting. "I know you're frightened. But we can't make decisions based on—"

"On what? The fact that everyone who didn't run is dead?"

Silence. Epistrophus set down his bread.

"I should go," he said.

Briseis turned to look at him. Eighteen years old. Too thin. A wisp of beard he was proud of. She had carried him when he was a child.

"You should eat something first," she said.

"Not hungry anymore." He grabbed the bread anyway, kissed the top of her head. "I'll bring you back some figs. The early ones are in."

He left. The door swung shut behind him.

Briseis stood at the window. On the table behind her, the stone mortar sat half-full of unground herbs—a poultice for Theron's wife, the work abandoned when she woke before dawn.

"I'll send the horses to your mother's village," Mynes said. "Tomorrow. Will that help?"

"I don't know."

He rose from the table, came around behind her, rested his hands on her shoulders. "We could try again tonight. The healer in Chryse—you were going to see her next week."

The child they'd been trying for. Two years of hoping.

"Maybe," she said.

He kissed her forehead. "I have to go. The delegation from Adramyttium."

"I know."

He gathered his cloak and left. Briseis stood alone at the window. The morning's routine tasks stretched ahead.

She picked up the pestle and began to grind.

The horns sounded.

She stopped. The pestle hung in her hand. The chickens had gone still, heads raised.

The horns sounded again.

Then the screaming.

---

Briseis ran.

Through the courtyard, into the street. People were everywhere. Women with children, old men hobbling, a cart overturned, but the screaming came from the walls.

"The gates!" someone shouted. "They're at the gates!"

She pushed through the crowd, fighting toward the main square. Mynes would have gone to the council hall. The delegation. He would be—

The smell hit her. Smoke. Copper. The reek of opened bodies.

She rounded the corner. The gates were open—not broken, open. The guards lay in pieces on the cobblestones. Greek soldiers poured through, fanning out through the streets.

At their head, a man with a spear. Smaller than she'd imagined. The soldiers parted around him.

Briseis turned and ran to the cellar.

---

The cellar was dark.

She pressed herself behind the wine jars, listening to the boots above. Men's voices, Greek. Something breaking. Laughter.

Her hands were shaking.

The boots came closer.

---

## ACHILLES

The walls fell in three hours.

Achilles wiped his spear on a dead man's cloak and went to inspect the captives.

The women huddled near the broken gates. Most were screaming—for husbands, for children. One stood at the edge of the group, arms wrapped around herself, staring at nothing.

"That one," he said.

Two soldiers pulled her from the group. She didn't resist.

Patroclus appeared at his shoulder. "She's in shock."

"I know."

He turned toward his tent.

## BRISEIS

Greek hands pulled her from the cellar.

She did not struggle.

They marched her through the streets. She saw bodies. Near the eastern wall, a man's body by a tower—young, thin, a wisp of beard. She looked away.

Near the main gates, another body. Well-dressed. Merchant's rings on his fingers.

She kept walking.

Outside the walls, she was put with other women. Sorted. A Greek with cold eyes came to look at them. Pointed at her.

She was put on a wagon. Watched the city burn as they drove away.

She watched it burn.

## HECTOR

The refugees arrived at dusk.

Seven. An old man, three women, three children. That was all.

"The Myrmidons came at dawn," the old man said. "Achilles led them. The walls held for three hours."

"They never do," Hector said.

He gave the orders—housing, food, a healer. The refugees shuffled through the gates.

"Fifth ally city this month," his aide said.

"I can count."

Hector stood at the gate and watched the sun set over the plain. The Greek camp sprawled in the distance—tents, ships on the beach. Five years now.

His father's strategy was simple: wait. The Greeks had no supply lines. Time was on Troy's side.

Hector had argued for this himself.

He didn't believe it anymore.

---

Andromache was waiting in their chambers with Astyanax on her lap.

"More refugees?"

"Seven. From Lyrnessus."

"I heard." She made room for him to sit beside her. "Astyanax took his first steps today."

Hector looked at his son. The boy's eyes were closing. "His first steps?"

"Three of them. He fell on the fourth."

"I'm sorry I missed it."

"You're always sorry."

He reached out and touched the boy's hair.

"The refugees said something," Andromache said. "About Achilles. That he doesn't take ransoms anymore. Just kills."

"I know."

"What does that mean?"

He didn't answer.

"Come to bed," she said. "Astyanax will sleep through. You should rest."

"In a moment."

He stayed at the window, looking out at the city. Troy slept beneath him—temples, palaces, the cramped houses where refugees crowded three families to a room.

The walls have held for a hundred years, someone in Lyrnessus had probably thought.

Hector stood at the window until the lamps burned low.

## ODYSSEUS

The division of spoils went late into the night.

Odysseus oversaw the accounting—gold weighed, captives counted, grain measured into sacks. The routine of plunder.

When the others had gone, he stayed. Sorted through the Trojan coins, the jewelry stripped from bodies, the small treasures of a city that no longer existed.

A bag of gold with Trojan markings. A seal ring with a crest he recognized.

He set these aside, added them to his stores, and went to find his tent.

---

## BRISEIS

They brought her to a tent.

A commander's tent. Animal skins on the floor. A camp bed. Maps on the table.

The Greek sat on the edge of the bed, armor half-removed, staring at nothing.

Briseis stood near the entrance. Waiting.

Nothing happened.

Another man entered—the one from the ridge. He looked at her, then at the Greek.

"You should eat something."

The Greek didn't respond.

"Achilles."

"I heard you."

So that was his name.

The other man left.

Time passed. The camp murmured outside—men eating, dividing spoils. Somewhere a woman wept.

"There's food," the Greek said. "If you want it."

Briseis didn't move.

He returned to staring at nothing.

She looked at him. Achilles.

He sat on the edge of his bed with his eyes empty and his hands still.

Briseis lowered herself to the ground near the entrance. Drew her knees to her chest.

Achilles didn't react.

The night passed. They didn't speak again.
