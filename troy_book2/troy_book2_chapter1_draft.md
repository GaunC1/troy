## BRISEIS

Epistrophus arrived while they were still eating.

"You're up early," Briseis said. Her younger brother stood in the doorway, still in his sleeping tunic, hair flattened on one side. "I thought you had the late watch."

"Traded with Cleon." He crossed to the table and reached for the bread. "There's a merchant from Miletus at the market. Syrian glass, the good kind with the blue threading."

Mynes looked up from his porridge. "Glass? We're at war."

"The merchant doesn't care. Neither does the glass." Epistrophus shoved bread in his mouth, speaking around it. "Besides, the war's on the coast. We're fine."

"Pedasus was fine," Briseis said. "Thebe was fine."

The table went quiet.

Epistrophus stopped chewing. Mynes set down his spoon. Through the window, Briseis could see the courtyard—clay pots, drying herbs, three chickens pecking at the dust.

"Bri." Mynes's voice was careful. "We've talked about this."

"We haven't. You keep telling me not to worry, and I keep telling you the Greeks are working inland, and nothing changes."

"Lyrnessus has walls."

"Pedasus had walls. They're rubble now."

"Pedasus is on a river. The Greeks need water access for their ships. We're two days from—"

"From what? Safety? Is that what you think two days buys us?"

Epistrophus looked between them, bread still in his hand. "Should I—"

"The walls have held for a hundred years," Mynes said.

"Against who? Bandits? Pirates?" Briseis pushed back from the table. "This is Achilles. He took Thebe in a morning. Your walls won't hold against Achilles."

"My walls."

"You know what I mean."

Mynes went still. "I know you're frightened. But we can't make decisions based on—"

"On what? The fact that everyone who didn't run is dead?"

Silence. Epistrophus set down his bread.

"I should go," he said.

Briseis turned to look at him. Eighteen years old. Too thin. That wisp of beard he refused to shave.

"You should eat something first," she said.

"Not hungry anymore." He grabbed the bread anyway, kissed the top of her head. "I'll bring you back some figs. The early ones are in."

He left. The door swung shut behind him.

Briseis stood at the window. On the table, the stone mortar sat half-full of unground herbs.

"I'll send the horses to your mother's village," Mynes said. "Tomorrow. Will that help?"

"I don't know."

He rose from the table, came around behind her, rested his hands on her shoulders. "We could try again tonight. The healer in Chryse—you were going to see her next week."

"Maybe," she said.

He kissed her forehead. "I have to go. The delegation from Adramyttium."

"I know."

He gathered his cloak and left.

Briseis picked up the pestle and began to grind.

The horns sounded.

She stopped. The pestle hung in her hand. The chickens had gone still, heads raised.

The horns sounded again.

Then the screaming.

---

Briseis ran.

Through the courtyard, into the street. Women with children, old men hobbling, a cart overturned. The screaming came from the walls.

"The gates!" someone shouted. "They're at the gates!"

She pushed through the crowd. Mynes would have gone to the council hall. The delegation. He would be—

Smoke. Copper. The reek of opened bodies.

She rounded the corner. The gates were open—not broken, open. The guards lay in pieces on the cobblestones. Greek soldiers poured through.

At their head, a man with a spear. Smaller than she'd imagined. The soldiers parted around him.

Briseis ran.

---

The cellar was dark.

She pressed herself behind the wine jars. Boots above. Men's voices, Greek. Something breaking. Laughter.

Her hands were shaking.

The boots came closer.

---

## ACHILLES

The walls fell in three hours.

Achilles wiped his spear on a dead man's cloak and went to inspect the captives.

The women huddled near the gates. Most were screaming. One stood at the edge of the group, arms wrapped around herself, staring at nothing.

"That one," he said.

Two soldiers pulled her from the group. She didn't resist.

Patroclus appeared at his shoulder. "She's in shock."

"I know."

He turned toward his tent.

## BRISEIS

Greek hands pulled her from the cellar.

They marched her through the streets. Bodies everywhere. Near the eastern wall, a man by a tower—young, thin, a wisp of beard. She looked away.

Near the main gates, another body. Well-dressed. Merchant's rings on his fingers.

She kept walking.

Outside the walls, she was put with other women. Sorted. A Greek with cold eyes pointed at her.

She was put on a wagon. Watched the city burn as they drove away.

## HECTOR

The refugees arrived at dusk.

Seven. An old man, three women, three children.

"The Myrmidons came at dawn," the old man said. "Achilles led them. The walls held for three hours."

"They never do," Hector said.

He gave the orders—housing, food, a healer. The refugees shuffled through the gates.

"Fifth ally city this month," his aide said.

"I can count."

---

Andromache was waiting in their chambers with Astyanax on her lap.

"More refugees?"

"Seven. From Lyrnessus."

"I heard." She made room for him to sit beside her. "Astyanax took his first steps today."

Hector looked at his son. The boy's eyes were closing. "His first steps?"

"Three of them. He fell on the fourth."

"I'm sorry I missed it."

"You're always sorry."

He touched the boy's hair.

"The refugees said something," Andromache said. "About Achilles. That he doesn't take ransoms anymore. Just kills."

"I know."

"What does that mean?"

He didn't answer.

"Come to bed," she said. "Astyanax will sleep through."

"In a moment."

He stayed at the window. Troy slept beneath him—temples, palaces, the cramped houses where refugees crowded three families to a room.

## ODYSSEUS

The division of spoils went late into the night.

Odysseus oversaw the accounting—gold weighed, captives counted, grain measured into sacks.

When the others had gone, he stayed. Sorted through the Trojan coins, the jewelry stripped from bodies.

A bag of gold with Trojan markings. A seal ring with a crest he recognized.

He held the ring up to the lamplight. Turned it. The seal was Priam's house—the royal mark of Troy.

He set it aside with the gold.

---

## BRISEIS

They brought her to a tent.

A commander's tent. Animal skins on the floor. A camp bed. Maps on the table.

The Greek sat on the edge of the bed, armor half-removed, staring at nothing.

Briseis stood near the entrance.

Nothing happened.

Another man entered—the one from earlier. He looked at her, then at the Greek.

"You should eat something."

The Greek didn't respond.

"Achilles."

"I heard you."

The other man left.

The camp murmured outside. Somewhere a woman wept.

"There's food," the Greek said. "If you want it."

Briseis didn't move.

He returned to staring at nothing.

She lowered herself to the ground near the entrance. Drew her knees to her chest.

Achilles didn't react.

Outside, the camp settled into sleep. The woman stopped weeping. The fires burned low.

Briseis watched the man who had destroyed her world.

He sat on the edge of his bed, not moving. His hands hung loose between his knees. His eyes were fixed on something she couldn't see.

She thought: Tomorrow he'll do this to another city. And another. And another.

She thought: I'm going to be here for all of it.

She closed her eyes.

When she opened them again, it was dawn, and Achilles was already gone.
