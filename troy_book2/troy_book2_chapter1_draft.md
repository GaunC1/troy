## BRISEIS

Epistrophus arrived while they were still eating.

"You're up early," Briseis said. Her younger brother stood in the doorway, still in his sleeping tunic, hair flattened on one side. "I thought you had the late watch."

"Traded with Cleon." He crossed to the table and reached for the bread. "There's a merchant from Miletus at the market. Syrian glass, the good kind with the blue threading."

Mynes looked up from his porridge. "Glass? We're at war."

"The merchant doesn't care. Neither does the glass." Epistrophus shoved bread in his mouth, speaking around it. "Besides, the war's on the coast. We're fine."

"Pedasus was fine," Briseis said. "Thebe was fine."

The table went quiet.

Epistrophus stopped chewing. Mynes set down his spoon. Through the window, Briseis could see the courtyard—clay pots, drying herbs, three chickens pecking at the dust.

"Bri." Mynes's voice was careful. "We've talked about this."

"We haven't. You keep telling me not to worry, and I keep telling you the Greeks are working inland, and nothing changes."

"Lyrnessus has walls."

"Pedasus had walls. They're rubble now."

"Pedasus is on a river. The Greeks need water access for their ships. We're two days from—"

"From what? Safety? Is that what you think two days buys us?"

Epistrophus looked between them, bread still in his hand. "Should I—"

"The walls have held for a hundred years," Mynes said.

"Against who? Bandits? Pirates?" Briseis pushed back from the table. "This is Achilles. He took Thebe in a morning. Your walls won't hold against Achilles."

"My walls."

"You know what I mean."

Mynes went still. "I know you're frightened. But we can't make decisions based on—"

"On what? The fact that everyone who didn't run is dead?"

Silence. Epistrophus set down his bread.

"I should go," he said.

Briseis turned to look at him. Eighteen years old. Too thin. That wisp of beard he refused to shave.

"You should eat something first," she said.

"Not hungry anymore." He grabbed the bread anyway, kissed the top of her head. "I'll bring you back some figs. The early ones are in."

He left. The door swung shut behind him.

Briseis stood at the window. On the table, the stone mortar sat half-full of unground herbs.

"I'll send the horses to your mother's village," Mynes said. "Tomorrow. Will that help?"

"I don't know."

He rose from the table, came around behind her, rested his hands on her shoulders. "We could try again tonight. The healer in Chryse—you were going to see her next week."

"Maybe," she said.

He kissed her forehead. "I have to go. The delegation from Adramyttium."

"I know."

He gathered his cloak and left.

Briseis picked up the pestle and began to grind.

The horns sounded.

She stopped. The pestle hung in her hand. The chickens had gone still, heads raised.

The horns sounded again.

Then the screaming.

---

Briseis ran.

Through the courtyard, into the street. Women with children, old men hobbling, a cart overturned. The screaming came from the walls.

"The gates!" someone shouted. "They're at the gates!"

She pushed through the crowd. Mynes would have gone to the council hall. The delegation. He would be—

Smoke. Copper. The reek of opened bodies.

She rounded the corner. The gates were open—not broken, open. The guards lay in pieces on the cobblestones. Greek soldiers poured through.

At their head, a man with a spear. Smaller than she'd imagined. The soldiers parted around him.

Briseis ran.

---

The cellar was dark.

She pressed herself behind the wine jars. Boots above. Men's voices, Greek. Something breaking. Laughter.

Her mouth opened—a scream rising in her throat. She bit down on her own hand instead. Hard enough to taste copper.

The boots came closer.

She pressed deeper into the shadows. Waited. Her hands were shaking, but her jaw stayed clenched.

---

## ACHILLES

The walls fell in three hours.

Achilles wiped his spear on a dead man's cloak and went to inspect the captives.

The women huddled near the gates.

Achilles's eyes passed over them—the ones who clawed at the soldiers, the ones who wailed and begged. His gaze stopped on one standing at the edge of the group, arms wrapped around herself. Silent. Staring at nothing.

"That one," he said.

Two soldiers pulled her from the group. She didn't resist.

Patroclus appeared at his shoulder. "She's in shock."

"I know."

He turned toward his tent.

---

## BRISEIS

Greek hands pulled her from the cellar.

They marched her through the streets. Bodies everywhere. Near the eastern wall, a man by a tower—young, thin, a wisp of beard. She looked away.

Near the main gates, another body. Well-dressed. Merchant's rings on his fingers.

She kept walking.

Outside the walls, she was put with other women. Sorted.

She stood at the edge of the group while others wailed. Her eyes moved—counting the tents, noting the rhythm of guard changes, marking where they kept the horses. Forty guards. Maybe fifty. The horses were picketed to the north.

A Greek with cold eyes pointed at her. She didn't flinch.

She was put on a wagon. Watched the city burn as they drove away.

---

## HECTOR

The refugees arrived at dusk.

Seven. An old man, three women, three children.

"The Myrmidons came at dawn," the old man said. "Achilles led them. The walls held for three hours."

"They never do," Hector said.

He gave the orders—housing, food, a healer. The refugees shuffled through the gates.

"Fifth ally city this month," his aide said.

"I can count."

---

Dawn found Hector on the walls with his captains.

He pointed to the Greek camp. "They've moved their forges closer to the ships. Why?"

A captain shrugged. "Convenience? The iron shipments come by sea."

"Find out." Hector kept his eyes on the distant camp. "And reinforce the western approach. If they're building something, we need to know what."

"Yes, my lord."

The captain left. Hector stayed on the walls, watching the smoke rise from the Greek forges, trying to read the shape of what was coming.

---

Andromache was waiting in their chambers with Astyanax on her lap.

"More refugees?"

"Seven. From Lyrnessus."

"I heard." She was holding a pair of soft leather boots—baby-sized, half-finished. Her needle kept moving as she spoke. "Astyanax took his first steps today."

Hector looked at his son. The boy's eyes were closing. "His first steps?"

"Three of them. He fell on the fourth." She held up the boots. "He'll need these by next week. I'm making them myself. The cobbler's son died at Lyrnessus."

"I'm sorry I missed it."

"You're always sorry."

He touched the boy's hair.

"The refugees said something," Andromache said. "About Achilles. That he doesn't take ransoms anymore. Just kills."

"I know."

"What does that mean?"

He didn't answer.

"Come to bed," she said. "Astyanax will sleep through."

"In a moment."

He stayed at the window. Troy slept beneath him—temples, palaces, the cramped houses where refugees crowded three families to a room.

---

## ODYSSEUS

The division of spoils went late into the night.

Odysseus oversaw the accounting—gold weighed, captives counted, grain measured into sacks.

When the others had gone, he stayed. Sorted through the Trojan coins, the jewelry stripped from bodies.

A bag of gold with Trojan markings. A seal ring with a crest he recognized.

He held the ring up to the lamplight. Turned it. The seal was Priam's house—the royal mark of Troy.

He set it aside with the gold.

## BRISEIS

They brought her to a tent.

A commander's tent. Animal skins on the floor. A camp bed. Maps on the table.

The Greek sat on the edge of the bed, armor half-removed, staring at nothing.

Briseis stood near the entrance.

Nothing happened.

Another man entered—the one from earlier. He looked at her, then at the Greek.

"You should eat something."

The Greek didn't respond.

"Achilles."

"I heard you."

The other man left.

The camp murmured outside. Somewhere a woman wept.

"There's food," the Greek said. "If you want it."

Briseis didn't move.

He returned to staring at nothing.

She lowered herself to the ground near the entrance. Drew her knees to her chest.

Achilles didn't react.

Outside, the camp settled into sleep. The woman stopped weeping. The fires burned low.

Briseis watched the man who had destroyed her world.

He sat on the edge of his bed, picked up a knife from the table beside him, and began to sharpen it. Methodical. The rasp of stone on bronze filled the silence. His eyes were fixed on something she couldn't see, but his hands kept moving—preparing. Even if he didn't know for what.

She thought: Tomorrow he'll do this to another city. And another. And another.

She thought: I'm going to be here for all of it.

Later that night, he came to her.

His hands were calloused, rougher than Mynes's had been. His weight pressed her into the camp bed. His eyes stayed fixed on the canvas above her, on something she couldn't see. When it was over, he rolled away and lay with his back to her, a wall of muscle and scar tissue.

She stared at the tent's ceiling. Her body ached. Outside, the camp fires crackled and a dog barked twice.

He fell asleep. She listened to his breathing slow, listened to the small sounds he made in dreams—half-words, names she didn't recognize.

In the morning, he was already gone.

The second night was the same. The third. The fourth. She learned the sounds of his breathing. The way his body twitched in dreams. The scars on his back—a puckered wound below his left shoulder blade, a long thin line across his ribs, a burn on his right arm. She could trace them in the darkness without looking.

On the fifth night, he spoke to her. "What's your name?"

She told him.

He repeated it once, quietly, as if testing the shape of it. Then he turned away and slept.

On the seventh night, he asked: "Were you married?"

"Yes."

"Did you love him?"

She didn't answer. He didn't ask again.

The nights continued. She stopped counting them.

And then, one night, before he could reach for her, she spoke.

"Why don't you sleep?"

He went still. She had never asked him anything. Never spoken first.

He lay down beside her. Didn't touch her. Didn't answer.

But he didn't leave.

The next night, something shifted.

He came to her as he always did, silent, absent. But when it was over, he didn't turn away. He lay beside her, his breathing ragged, his face half-lit by the dying lamp.

"I don't know why I keep doing this," he said.

She didn't answer.

"I don't want to. I don't want any of this."

She lay very still.

"Then why do you?" she asked. Her voice was rusty. She hadn't spoken in days.

He was silent for a long time. The lamp guttered. Shadows moved on the canvas.

"Because if I stop," he said, "I'll have to feel something else."

She didn't ask what.

The next night, when he reached for her, she reached back. Not a reflex—a choice. Her hand found the scar on his shoulder blade, the one she had traced so many times in the dark. She pressed it. Deliberately.

He paused. Looked at her.

She held his gaze. Neither of them looked away.

In the morning, she woke with his arm across her waist, his breath warm against her hair.
