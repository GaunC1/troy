## BRISEIS

The smell of the Greek camp was salt and smoke and unwashed men.

Briseis had learned to breathe through her mouth. She had learned many things in the weeks since Lyrnessus fell—which paths to take to avoid the Locrian soldiers who grabbed at passing women, which cook fires had scraps to spare, which tents belonged to which kings. The Myrmidons kept to the northern end of the camp, near the black ships with their painted eyes. Agamemnon's pavilion rose in the center, larger than any house in her father's village, its purple banners snapping in the sea wind. The Ithacans camped to the south, their tents plain and practical, their fires burning low even at night.

She knew which kings hated each other. Most of them hated Agamemnon, though they smiled when he passed. Ajax the Greater and Ajax the Lesser shared a name and nothing else—the Greater was an ox of a man who rarely spoke, the Lesser a lean Locrian with quick hands and a reputation that made women cross to the other side of the camp when they saw him coming. Diomedes and Odysseus ate together most evenings, their heads bent close, speaking in voices too low to carry.

She knew Achilles barely left his tent. Patroclus brought him food—barley bread and salted fish, sometimes wine—and sat with him while the light changed. Some days she heard the lyre, soft notes drifting through the canvas. Other days there was only silence.

Today something was different.

Men were gathering near the assembly ground, a cleared space between Agamemnon's pavilion and the horse lines. Voices carried on the morning air—not the usual haggling over plunder or dice games, but something sharper. An argument. An accusation.

Briseis moved closer, keeping to the edges where the crowd thinned. A captive was invisible if she was quiet, if she kept her eyes down, if she made herself small. She had learned that too.

A man stood before the assembly, hands bound with leather cords. She didn't know his name. He was tall, well-made, with grey threading through dark hair. His face was still.

"A letter appears from nowhere." His voice carried across the crowd, clear and measured. "Found near the Trojan lines—but no one saw who dropped it. No Trojan messenger was captured. No courier confessed."

Murmurs rippled through the assembly. Briseis counted perhaps two hundred men—soldiers, captains, the lesser kings who commanded a dozen ships or fewer. The great kings sat on their camp stools near the front: Agamemnon in his purple cloak, the lion of Mycenae worked in gold thread at his shoulder; old Nestor beside him, his beard white as sea-foam; Diomedes with his scarred face; Menelaus sitting apart, as he always did now, his eyes on something no one else could see.

"If I were taking Trojan gold," the bound man continued, "would I hide it in my own tent? Beneath my own bedding, where a child could find it? Would I leave a letter bearing the seal of Priam in my own document case?"

A soldier near Briseis shifted his weight. "Makes sense," he muttered to his companion. "If you're going to betray the army, you don't leave the evidence lying about."

"Quiet," the other said. "Odysseus is speaking next."

Briseis watched the bound man's eyes move across the crowd. Searching. Finding.

Holding.

"Ask yourselves who benefits from my death."

## ODYSSEUS

Palamedes had demanded his bonds removed. His right as a king's son, as a commander of ships, as a man who had served the army for nine years. Agamemnon had allowed it. The leather cords lay in the dust now, coiled like shed snakeskin.

A mistake, Odysseus thought. Palamedes looked innocent without them. He stood straight-backed, his hands open at his sides, his voice the reasonable voice of a man with nothing to hide. The voice of the man who had organized the supply lines at Aulis when the army was starving, who had devised the system of watch-fires that kept the camp safe at night, who had built the siege engines that battered at Troy's walls.

The voice of the man who had placed an infant in the path of a plow.

"The gold was planted." Palamedes turned slowly, surveying the assembly. "The letter is a forgery. I've served this army since we landed on these shores. I've built your siege engines. I've rationed your grain. I've done nothing but work for our victory—and now I am accused of treason."

Heads were nodding. Near the front, Diomedes leaned over to murmur something to Ajax.

"By whom?" Palamedes continued. "By the man who suggested the search. The man who found the gold. The man who has hated me since the beach at Ithaca, nine years ago."

Silence.

Odysseus kept his face still. He thought of Penelope's voice the morning he left: *What did he do to you?* He thought of Telemachus crying as the ship pulled away from shore.

"Nine years ago," Palamedes said, "I came to Ithaca to recruit a man for this war. The prophecy said we could not take Troy without him—without his cleverness, his cunning, his way with words." A thin smile. "He did not wish to come. He had a wife. A newborn son. A kingdom to tend. So he pretended to be mad."

Laughter from some of the younger soldiers—the ones who had heard the story but never seen it, who thought it was just a tale for the wine halls.

"He yoked an ox and a donkey to his plow. Mismatched beasts that pulled against each other, turning the furrows crooked. He sowed salt instead of seed. His wife stood weeping by the house. His servants wrung their hands. Mad, they said. Mad King Odysseus, his wits shattered by grief or the gods or the wine. Mad, and therefore unfit for war."

Palamedes's eyes found Odysseus in the crowd.

"I placed his infant son in the path of the plow."

The laughter died.

"He swerved. His sanity was proved." Palamedes held the gaze. "He has never forgiven me."

The silence stretched. Odysseus could feel the doubt spreading, could see men exchanging glances, could hear the whispered questions passing lip to ear to lip again.

He rose.

"I have known Palamedes for nine years." His voice was quiet. "I have served beside him. Eaten at his fire. I do not want to believe this."

He let the silence stretch.

"But the evidence is here. The gold was in his tent—Trojan gold, stamped with Priam's mark. The letter bears the royal seal." He spread his hands. "Palamedes asks who benefits from his death. I ask: who benefits from his doubt? Who benefits if we look at proof and call it trickery? Who benefits if we turn on each other, accusing the accusers, until no man trusts his neighbor?"

He paused.

"Palamedes is clever. We all know this. Clever enough to make us doubt even when the proof is before us. Clever enough to stand here, with Trojan gold in his tent and Priam's seal on his letters, and convince us that we are the fools for believing our own eyes."

He sat down.

The vote was called. Hands rose. Were counted.

It fell against Palamedes by seven votes.

## BRISEIS

They dug the pit outside the camp, near the horse lines where the ground was soft.

Briseis followed the crowd at a distance, keeping to the trampled grass where the supply wagons had worn ruts in the earth. No one stopped her. No one saw her. She was a woman in a brown dress, one more piece of plunder, as invisible as the tent poles or the cook pots.

The pit was not deep—perhaps to a man's waist. The soldiers who dug it worked quickly, their shovels biting into the sandy soil, tossing the dirt into a mound that grew beside them. When they finished, they climbed out and joined the ring of men forming around the edge.

Palamedes stood at the pit's lip. His hands were bound again, the leather cords tight around his wrists. His face was calm. He was not weeping, not begging, not struggling against the guards who held his arms. He stood straight, as he had stood in the assembly, and looked across the crowd.

Briseis had seen executions before. In Lyrnessus, the council had sentenced a man to death for killing his brother over an inheritance. He had wept and pleaded and soiled himself when they brought him to the square. This was different. This man looked at his executioners the way a father looks at disappointing children.

The soldiers around the pit were bending down, picking up stones from the mound. Ordinary stones, grey and brown, the size of a man's fist. Some were larger. Some were jagged. The soldiers tested their weight, hefted them, found grips that felt right in their palms.

Palamedes's eyes moved across the crowd. Searching.

Found someone.

Held.

His lips moved. Briseis was too far away to hear, but she saw the shape of the words: *You know what you are.*

The first stone hit his shoulder.

He stumbled. Caught himself. The second stone caught him in the chest, and she heard the sound it made—a wet crack, like a melon dropped on flagstones. His breath left him in a grunt.

The stones came faster now. Men threw, bent, picked up another, threw again. The sound of them was steady, rhythmic, almost like rain on a roof—*thock thock thock*—and under it the sounds of impact, of breath, of something breaking.

Palamedes was on his knees. His bound hands came up, trying to shield his face. A stone struck his forearm. Another caught his temple. Blood, very red, running into his eyes.

He was on the ground now. Still moving. The stones kept coming.

The sounds from the pit stopped.

The crowd dispersed. Briseis stayed a moment longer, watching the flies gather.

They can do this to their own, she thought. They can do anything.

She walked back to Achilles's tent. She couldn't picture Mynes's face anymore—just a blur where a man used to be. But she could picture Achilles. Every line of him.

She went to fetch from the cistern.

She didn't look back.

## HELEN

The healing house had been a temple once.

You could still see it in the columns that framed the entrance, in the faded paint on the walls—Asclepius with his snake-wound staff, Hygieia with her bowl of sacred water. The altar had been moved to make room for pallets, a dozen of them crowding the narrow space. The smell of incense had given way to blood and rot and the sharp bite of wound-wash.

Helen held a soldier down while the healer worked.

He was young, this soldier—barely more than a boy, with downy cheeks and eyes that rolled white with pain. An arrow had gone through his thigh, missing the artery by a finger's width. The shaft had broken off inside when he fell. Now the healer was cutting, widening the wound, searching for the iron head that was buried somewhere in the ruined muscle.

The soldier screamed. Thrashed. Helen leaned her full weight on his shoulders, pressing him into the pallet. The rough wool scraped her forearms. She could feel his muscles knotting beneath her, the desperate strength of a body trying to escape what was being done to it.

"Hold him," the healer said. "Almost there."

The healer was a small woman with grey hair and hands that never trembled. Chryseis, her name was—one of the temple women who had stayed when the war came, who had traded prayers for bandages, sacred songs for the practical work of keeping men alive.

Her bronze knife moved. The soldier's scream broke into a sob. Something grated against metal.

"There." Chryseis held up the arrowhead, dark with blood and trailing shreds of tissue. She dropped it into a bronze bowl. It clinked against others—a dozen arrowheads, a broken knife blade, a bit of bone. The day's harvest.

The soldier had passed out. His face was grey, slick with sweat. His chest rose and fell in shallow, rapid breaths.

"Next," Chryseis said.

Helen straightened. Her arms ached. Her back ached. The front of her dress was wet with the soldier's blood, cooling now, turning the fabric stiff.

She moved to the basin in the corner. The water was warm, rust-colored. She washed her hands anyway, watching the blood swirl away from her fingers.

"You're good at this."

One of the Trojan healers—a young woman with tired eyes and her hair pulled back in a knot. Helen had seen her before, working the night shifts when the other healers went home to sleep. She had never spoken to Helen. None of them spoke to Helen.

"You have steady hands," the woman continued. "Most people flinch."

"I've had practice."

The woman looked at her. Her face was flat, unreadable.

"It doesn't make up for anything."

Helen held the gaze. There was nothing to say to that. Nothing that would matter.

"I know."

The woman nodded. Returned to her patient—an older man with a wound in his side that was turning black at the edges. She began to cut away the dead flesh.

Another soldier was carried in. Arrow wound in the shoulder, the shaft still embedded, the fletching bright with his blood. His face was the face of all the soldiers Helen had seen: pain and fear and the desperate hope that someone could help him.

Helen moved to hold him down.

## HECTOR

The sunset painted the walls of Troy the color of old blood.

Hector crossed the courtyard with his men's voices still ringing in his ears—the ragged cheer they'd raised when he called the retreat, the prayers muttered over the bodies of the fallen, the curses directed at the Greeks who had driven them back. Eight men dead. Twelve wounded. A handful of Greeks killed in return. The mathematics of attrition, playing out as it had played out for nine years.

His armor was heavy on his shoulders. The bronze cuirass, worked with the pattern of a charging lion. The greaves that strapped tight around his calves. The arm guards that had saved him from a spear-thrust three hours ago—the Greek's point had skidded across the bronze, leaving a bright scar in the patina of old blood and dust.

The blood on the armor was still wet. Some of it was his—a cut on his forearm, not deep, already crusting over. Most of it was not.

Andromache waited at the entrance to their chambers. Astyanax was in her arms, drowsy with the late hour, his head resting on her shoulder. The boy was dressed in a small tunic dyed Tyrian purple—a gift from Priam, fit for a prince. His feet were bare, his toes curling against his mother's hip.

Hector stopped at the threshold. He had not washed. Had not removed his armor. Had come straight from the walls because Andromache had sent word that she needed to see him, and when Andromache sent word, Hector came.

Astyanax looked up.

The boy's face shifted—the drowsy softness of a child about to smile, the eyes brightening with recognition—and then he saw the helmet.

The helmet his father wore to war. The bronze face with its empty eye-slits, the horsehair crest that made a man look twice his height, the metal that caught the dying light and threw it back as blood-red fire. A monster's face. A killer's face.

Astyanax screamed.

The sound echoed off the stone walls, high and thin and terrified. The scream of a child who sees a stranger where his father should be, who sees death standing in his mother's doorway wearing his father's body.

Hector did not move.

Astyanax was crying now, the screams giving way to heaving sobs, his small body shaking as he buried his face in Andromache's shoulder. His hands clutched at her dress, pulling it tight against her throat.

Andromache's eyes stayed on Hector. She did not speak. She did not need to.

Slowly, Hector reached up. Unbuckled the chin strap. Lifted the helmet from his head.

The bronze face stared up at nothing as he set it on the ground. The horsehair crest pooled in the dust like spilled wine.

"It's me," he said. His voice was rough, scraped raw by a day of shouting orders over the din of battle. "It's me, little one. Just me."

Astyanax peeked. One eye, then two, peering over Andromache's shoulder.

He saw his father's face. The face he knew—tired, dust-streaked, with lines around the eyes that hadn't been there a year ago. Not the monster. Not the bronze death-mask. Just his father.

The boy reached for him.

Hector took his son from Andromache's arms. Held him close, the small body pressed against the blood-crusted armor. Astyanax's hands found the edge of his cloak, the wool stiff with dried blood, and gripped it like a drowning man grips a rope.

"Don't go back out," Andromache said. "Not tonight."

"I have to."

"I know."

He looked at her. At the shadows under her eyes. At the grey that was threading through her dark hair, though she was not yet twenty-five. At the way she held herself, straight-backed, unbending, because if she bent she might break.

He looked at his son. At the small fingers still clutching his cloak. At the tears drying on the round cheeks.

He looked at the helmet on the ground. The empty eyes. The bronze face that had made his child scream.

"One more patrol," he said. "Then I'll come home."

He handed Astyanax back to Andromache. The boy whimpered, reached for him, tried to hold on to the cloak.

"Hector."

He stopped.

"Come home."

He picked up the helmet. Settled it on his head. The bronze closed around his face like a cage.

"I always do," he said.

He walked back toward the walls. The sunset was fading now, the blood-red light giving way to purple shadows. Behind him, his son started crying again.

## ODYSSEUS

The basin was bronze, old and dented, a veteran of ten years' campaigns.

Odysseus poured water from the pitcher and watched it fill the bowl. Clear water, cool from the cistern near the supply tents. He had drunk from that cistern his first week in the camp, back when Troy's walls seemed impossible and the war seemed like it might end by winter.

Nine years ago. Telemachus had been an infant then, small enough to hold in one hand. He would be—what now? Ten? Eleven? Odysseus had lost count somewhere around year six. The boy would be tall now. Would have learned to ride. Would have asked about his father, perhaps, and Penelope would have told him—what? That his father was a hero? That his father was clever? That his father did what needed to be done?

He put his hands in the water.

He had half expected it to turn red. Some sign of what he had done, some mark that the water would recognize even if men did not. He had picked up a stone—it was important to be seen participating, important that no one whisper that Odysseus of Ithaca had held back while the army did justice—but he had thrown it at the pit's edge, where the dirt was soft. The killing had been done by other hands. His own were clean.

The water stayed clear.

He lifted his hands, watched the droplets fall back into the basin. No blood. No stain. Just water and bronze and the lamplight flickering on the surface.

He dried his hands on a cloth. The cloth was rough, soldier's linen, nothing like the fine wool Penelope used to weave on her loom. He thought of her fingers moving through the warp and weft, the soft click of the heddles, the way she hummed while she worked. Old songs from her childhood. Songs about heroes and homecomings.

The trial had been just. The evidence had been clear. Palamedes was a traitor who had been caught and punished, and in a month no one would remember the details—only that justice had been done, that the army had protected itself, that the war would continue as it had always continued.

Odysseus lay down on his cot.

The canvas above him was still. Outside, the camp was settling into its evening routines—the clatter of cook pots, the low murmur of soldiers swapping stories, the occasional bark of laughter from the wine-tent. Somewhere a dog was barking. It barked twice, then fell silent.

He closed his eyes.

He waited for Palamedes's face to appear. For the calm voice to echo in the darkness: *You know what you are.* For the weight of the first stone in his palm, the arc of its flight, the sound it made when it struck.

Nothing came.

The darkness behind his eyes was empty. The silence in his tent was just silence. The thing he had done was done, and it seemed very far away now, as distant as Ithaca, as small as a stone thrown at the edge of a pit.

He thought of home. The olive tree that grew through the center of his bedchamber, the living wood he had built his marriage bed around. The harbor where his ships had rested before the war. The hillside where he had pretended to be mad, plowing salt into the earth while Palamedes watched.

He thought of Telemachus. Tried to picture what the boy looked like now—Penelope's dark hair, or his own? Her quiet patience, or his restlessness? Would the boy know him when he finally walked through the door? Would he know the boy?

The lamp guttered.

Odysseus slept.

He slept deeply, dreamlessly, the way he had not slept since the beach at Aulis. No ghost troubled him. No voice spoke in the darkness. No face appeared behind his eyes.

He slept well.

He had not expected to.
