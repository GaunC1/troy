## BRISEIS

The smell of the Greek camp was salt and smoke and unwashed men.

Briseis had learned to breathe through her mouth. She had learned many things in the weeks since Lyrnessus fell—which paths to take to avoid the Locrian soldiers who grabbed at passing women, which cook fires had scraps to spare, which tents belonged to which kings. The Myrmidons kept to the northern end of the camp, near the black ships with their painted eyes. Agamemnon's pavilion rose in the center, larger than any house in her father's village, its purple banners snapping in the sea wind. The Ithacans camped to the south, their tents plain and practical, their fires burning low even at night.

She knew which kings hated each other. Most of them hated Agamemnon, though they smiled when he passed. Ajax the Greater and Ajax the Lesser shared a name and nothing else—the Greater was an ox of a man who rarely spoke, the Lesser a lean Locrian with quick hands and a reputation that made women cross to the other side of the camp when they saw him coming. Diomedes and Odysseus ate together most evenings, their heads bent close, speaking in voices too low to carry.

She knew Achilles barely left his tent. Patroclus brought him food—barley bread and salted fish, sometimes wine—and sat with him while the light changed. Some days she heard the lyre, soft notes drifting through the canvas. Other days there was only silence.

Today something was different.

Men were gathering near the assembly ground, a cleared space between Agamemnon's pavilion and the horse lines. Voices carried on the morning air—not the usual haggling over plunder or dice games, but something sharper. An argument. An accusation.

Briseis moved closer, keeping to the edges where the crowd thinned. A captive was invisible if she was quiet, if she kept her eyes down, if she made herself small. She had learned that too.

A man stood before the assembly, hands bound with leather cords. She didn't know his name. He was tall, well-made, with grey threading through dark hair. His face was still.

"A letter appears from nowhere." His voice carried across the crowd, clear and measured. "Found near the Trojan lines—but no one saw who dropped it. No Trojan messenger was captured. No courier confessed."

Murmurs rippled through the assembly. Briseis counted perhaps two hundred men—soldiers, captains, the lesser kings who commanded a dozen ships or fewer. The great kings sat on their camp stools near the front: Agamemnon in his purple cloak, the lion of Mycenae worked in gold thread at his shoulder; old Nestor beside him, his beard white as sea-foam; Diomedes with his scarred face; Menelaus sitting apart, as he always did now, his eyes on something no one else could see.

"If I were taking Trojan gold," the bound man continued, "would I hide it in my own tent? Beneath my own bedding, where a child could find it? Would I leave a letter bearing the seal of Priam in my own document case?"

A soldier near Briseis shifted his weight. "Makes sense," he muttered to his companion. "If you're going to betray the army, you don't leave the evidence lying about."

"Quiet," the other said. "Odysseus is speaking next."

Briseis watched the bound man's eyes move across the crowd. Searching. Finding.

Holding.

"Ask yourselves who benefits from my death."

## ODYSSEUS

Palamedes had demanded his bonds removed. His right as a king's son, as a commander of ships, as a man who had served the army for nine years. Agamemnon had allowed it. The leather cords lay in the dust now, coiled like shed snakeskin.

A mistake, Odysseus thought. Palamedes looked innocent without them. He stood straight-backed, his hands open at his sides, his voice the reasonable voice of a man with nothing to hide. The voice of the man who had organized the supply lines at Aulis when the army was starving, who had devised the system of watch-fires that kept the camp safe at night, who had built the siege engines that battered at Troy's walls.

The voice of the man who had placed an infant in the path of a plow.

"The gold was planted." Palamedes turned slowly, surveying the assembly. "The letter is a forgery. I've served this army since we landed on these shores. I've built your siege engines. I've rationed your grain. I've done nothing but work for our victory—and now I am accused of treason."

Heads were nodding. Near the front, Diomedes leaned over to murmur something to Ajax.

"By whom?" Palamedes continued. "By the man who suggested the search. The man who found the gold. The man who has hated me since the beach at Ithaca, nine years ago."

Silence.

Odysseus kept his face still. He thought of Penelope's voice the morning he left: *What did he do to you?* He thought of Telemachus crying as the ship pulled away from shore.

"Nine years ago," Palamedes said, "I came to Ithaca to recruit a man for this war. The prophecy said we could not take Troy without him—without his cleverness, his cunning, his way with words." A thin smile. "He did not wish to come. He had a wife. A newborn son. A kingdom to tend. So he pretended to be mad."

Laughter from some of the younger soldiers—the ones who had heard the story but never seen it, who thought it was just a tale for the wine halls.

"He yoked an ox and a donkey to his plow. Mismatched beasts that pulled against each other, turning the furrows crooked. He sowed salt instead of seed. His wife stood weeping by the house. His servants wrung their hands. Mad, they said. Mad King Odysseus, his wits shattered by grief or the gods or the wine. Mad, and therefore unfit for war."

Palamedes's eyes found Odysseus in the crowd.

"I placed his infant son in the path of the plow."

The laughter died.

"He swerved. His sanity was proved." Palamedes held the gaze. "He has never forgiven me."

The silence stretched. Odysseus could feel the doubt spreading, could see men exchanging glances, could hear the whispered questions passing lip to ear to lip again.

He rose.

"I have known Palamedes for nine years." His voice was quiet. "I have served beside him. Eaten at his fire. I do not want to believe this."

He let the silence stretch.

"But the evidence is here. The gold was in his tent—Trojan gold, stamped with Priam's mark. The letter bears the royal seal." He spread his hands. "Palamedes asks who benefits from his death. I ask: who benefits from his doubt? Who benefits if we look at proof and call it trickery? Who benefits if we turn on each other, accusing the accusers, until no man trusts his neighbor?"

He paused.

"Palamedes is clever. We all know this. Clever enough to make us doubt even when the proof is before us. Clever enough to stand here, with Trojan gold in his tent and Priam's seal on his letters, and convince us that we are the fools for believing our own eyes."

He sat down.

The vote was called. Hands rose. Were counted.

It fell against Palamedes by seven votes.

## BRISEIS

They dug the pit outside the camp, near the horse lines where the ground was soft.

Briseis followed the crowd at a distance, keeping to the trampled grass where the supply wagons had worn ruts in the earth. No one stopped her. No one saw her. She was a woman in a brown dress, one more piece of plunder, as invisible as the tent poles or the cook pots.

The pit was not deep—perhaps to a man's waist. The soldiers who dug it worked quickly, their shovels biting into the sandy soil, tossing the dirt into a mound that grew beside them. When they finished, they climbed out and joined the ring of men forming around the edge.

At the back of the crowd, she saw Achilles. Patroclus stood beside him, his jaw tight.

"This is wrong." Patroclus's voice carried to where Briseis stood.

Achilles said nothing.

Patroclus started to push forward, toward the pit. Achilles's hand closed on his arm. Held him in place.

They watched.

Palamedes stood at the pit's lip. His hands were bound again, the leather cords tight around his wrists. His face was calm. He was not weeping, not begging, not struggling against the guards who held his arms. He stood straight, as he had stood in the assembly, and looked across the crowd.

Briseis had seen executions before. In Lyrnessus, the council had sentenced a man to death for killing his brother over an inheritance. He had wept and pleaded and soiled himself when they brought him to the square. This was different. This man looked at his executioners the way a father looks at disappointing children.

The soldiers around the pit were bending down, picking up stones from the mound. Ordinary stones, grey and brown, the size of a man's fist. Some were larger. Some were jagged. The soldiers tested their weight, hefted them, found grips that felt right in their palms.

Palamedes's eyes moved across the crowd. Searching.

Found someone.

Held.

His lips moved. Briseis was too far away to hear, but she saw the shape of the words: *You know what you are.*

The first stone hit his shoulder.

He stumbled. Caught himself. The second stone caught him in the chest, and she heard the sound it made—a wet crack, like a melon dropped on flagstones. His breath left him in a grunt.

The stones came faster now. Men threw, bent, picked up another, threw again. The sound of them was steady, rhythmic, almost like rain on a roof—*thock thock thock*—and under it the sounds of impact, of breath, of something breaking.

Palamedes was on his knees. His bound hands came up, trying to shield his face. A stone struck his forearm. Another caught his temple. Blood, very red, running into his eyes.

He was on the ground now. Still moving. The stones kept coming.

The sounds from the pit stopped.

The crowd dispersed. Briseis stayed a moment longer, watching the flies gather.

They can do this to their own, she thought. They can do anything.

She walked back toward Achilles's tent. She couldn't picture Mynes's face anymore—just a blur where a man used to be. But she could picture Achilles. Every line of him.

She passed the captive women's area. The place where they kept the ones who hadn't been claimed yet—the ones too old or too plain or too broken.

An older woman sat shivering against the fence. Her lips were blue. Fever, maybe. Or just the cold nights.

Briseis stopped.

She unwrapped the blanket from her own shoulders—the good wool one Patroclus had given her. Crossed to the woman. Wrapped it around her.

Another captive, younger, whispered: "You'll freeze."

"I sleep in his tent." Briseis straightened. "I won't freeze."

The women looked at her differently after that.

She went to fetch water from the cistern.

She didn't look back.

## PARIS

The skirmish was over before Paris reached the walls.

Greeks falling back across the plain, the Trojans not pursuing—they knew better than to chase too far from the gates. Bodies scattered in the dust. The usual cost.

Paris watched from the battlement, his bow in his hands.

One Greek officer was rallying his men. Three hundred yards out, well beyond spear range. He was shouting orders, pointing back toward the Trojan walls, organizing the retreat.

Paris drew.

The arrow rose, arced against the bright sky, and dropped.

The officer fell mid-word.

Silence on the walls. The Greeks below froze, looking at their commander, looking back toward Troy. No one had seen where the shot came from. No one could have—the distance was impossible.

Hector was beside him. Paris hadn't heard him approach.

His brother looked at the fallen Greek. Looked at Paris. Held the look for a long moment.

Said nothing.

Walked away.

Paris stayed on the walls, watching the Greeks drag their dead officer back toward the ships. His fingers traced the string of his bow, finding the familiar grooves worn smooth by years of practice.

Three hundred yards. In the right conditions, with the right angle, he could do it again.

## HELEN

The healing house had been a temple once.

You could still see it in the columns that framed the entrance, in the faded paint on the walls—Asclepius with his snake-wound staff, Hygieia with her bowl of sacred water. The altar had been moved to make room for pallets, a dozen of them crowding the narrow space. The smell of incense had given way to blood and rot and the sharp bite of wound-wash.

Chryseis looked up when Helen entered. Something flickered across her face—surprise, perhaps.

"You came yesterday too."

Helen rolled up her sleeves. "I'll come tomorrow."

She moved to the worst cases—the ones the other helpers avoided. The blackening wounds. The fevers that wouldn't break. The men who screamed when anyone touched them.

She held a soldier down while the healer worked.

He was young, this soldier—barely more than a boy, with downy cheeks and eyes that rolled white with pain. An arrow had gone through his thigh, missing the artery by a finger's width. The shaft had broken off inside when he fell. Now the healer was cutting, widening the wound, searching for the iron head that was buried somewhere in the ruined muscle.

The soldier screamed. Thrashed. Helen leaned her full weight on his shoulders, pressing him into the pallet. The rough wool scraped her forearms. She could feel his muscles knotting beneath her, the desperate strength of a body trying to escape what was being done to it.

"Hold him," the healer said. "Almost there."

The healer was a small woman with grey hair and hands that never trembled. Chryseis, her name was—one of the temple women who had stayed when the war came, who had traded prayers for bandages, sacred songs for the practical work of keeping men alive.

Her bronze knife moved. The soldier's scream broke into a sob. Something grated against metal.

"There." Chryseis held up the arrowhead, dark with blood and trailing shreds of tissue. She dropped it into a bronze bowl. It clinked against others—a dozen arrowheads, a broken knife blade, a bit of bone. The day's harvest.

The soldier had passed out. His face was grey, slick with sweat. His chest rose and fell in shallow, rapid breaths.

"Next," Chryseis said.

Helen straightened. Her arms ached. Her back ached. The front of her dress was wet with the soldier's blood, cooling now, turning the fabric stiff.

She moved to the basin in the corner. The water was warm, rust-colored. She washed her hands anyway, watching the blood swirl away from her fingers.

"You're good at this."

One of the Trojan healers—a young woman with tired eyes and her hair pulled back in a knot. Helen had seen her before, working the night shifts when the other healers went home to sleep. She had never spoken to Helen. None of them spoke to Helen.

"You have steady hands," the woman continued. "Most people flinch."

"I've had practice."

The woman looked at her. Her face was flat, unreadable.

"It doesn't make up for anything."

Helen held the gaze. There was nothing to say to that. Nothing that would matter.

"I know."

The woman nodded. Returned to her patient—an older man with a wound in his side that was turning black at the edges. She began to cut away the dead flesh.

Another soldier was carried in. Arrow wound in the shoulder, the shaft still embedded, the fletching bright with his blood. His face was the face of all the soldiers Helen had seen: pain and fear and the desperate hope that someone could help him.

Helen moved to hold him down.

---

Later, near the end of the day, there was one who couldn't be saved.

The wound in his belly had gone black. The fever had taken him past sense—he thrashed and screamed, seeing enemies that weren't there, fighting a battle already lost. The other healers had moved on to patients they could help.

Helen stayed.

She found the poppy bottle on the shelf where they kept the strongest medicines. Measured a dose into a cup—more than enough. Much more.

She knelt beside him. Lifted his head. Held the cup to his lips.

He drank, still thrashing. The bitter liquid spilled down his chin. She wiped it away with her sleeve.

His thrashing slowed. His screaming stopped. His eyes—wild a moment ago—found hers and held them. Something passed across his face. Recognition, perhaps. Or gratitude.

He closed his eyes.

Helen stayed until his chest stopped moving. Then she closed his eyes properly, straightened his limbs, and moved to the next bed.

No one had seen. No one asked.

## CASSANDRA

She found Andromache in the nursery, alone with Astyanax.

The boy was sleeping. His small chest rose and fell, rose and fell. His fist was curled against his cheek. He looked like Hector. Everyone said so.

"Take him."

Andromache looked up. Her face was tired, drawn. She had not been sleeping well. No one in Troy slept well anymore.

"Cassandra."

"Take him. Tonight. Go to your father's people in the mountains."

Andromache's hand moved to rest on her son's hair. Protective. Automatic.

"You've said this before."

"I'll say it until you listen." Cassandra moved closer. She did not speak in riddles. Not this time. "The walls will fall. The Greeks will come. And when they do—"

She stopped. The vision rose behind her eyes: a baby held by the ankles, the long fall, the sound it made when it hit the stones.

"When they do, what?" Andromache's voice was quiet.

Cassandra looked at the sleeping boy. At the small fingers, the soft cheeks, the chest rising and falling.

"Take him," she said again. "Before it's too late."

Andromache's hand tightened on her son's hair. She didn't dismiss Cassandra. Didn't call her mad.

But she didn't agree, either.

---

## ANDROMACHE

The refugee hall was chaos when she arrived.

Two families, shouting. A man with a bloody lip. A woman clutching a child. The guards at the entrance had their hands on their swords but hadn't drawn—this was a dispute among the displaced, not a crime.

Andromache pushed through before the guards could intervene.

"Enough."

Her voice cut through the shouting. The families fell silent. The man with the bloody lip wiped his mouth on his sleeve.

"What happened?"

Both families spoke at once. Andromache held up a hand. Pointed to the woman with the child.

"You. Speak."

The story came out—sleeping space, a corner that both families claimed, a shove that became a fight. The same story Andromache had heard a dozen times since the siege began. Too many people. Not enough room. Tempers fraying like old rope.

"You." She pointed to a boy near the door, one of the refugee children. "Fetch food from the kitchens. Bread and cheese." The boy ran.

She turned to the families. "There are empty rooms in the eastern quarter. The occupants died last week—camp fever. The rooms have been cleaned." She pointed to one family. "You take the corner room." To the other: "You take the one beside the courtyard."

The man with the bloody lip started to object. "But we were here first—"

"You were here fighting." Andromache's voice was quiet, but it carried. "You can take the room I've given you, or you can sleep in the stables."

Silence.

A guard stepped forward. "My lady, I can handle—"

"This is my house." She turned to look at him. "I'll manage it."

He stepped back.

The families gathered their belongings. The boy returned with bread and cheese. Andromache divided it between them, made sure the children ate first, and waited until they had left for their new rooms.

Only then did she return to the nursery, where her son was sleeping and Cassandra's words were still echoing in her ears.

---

## PRIAM

The merchants would not stop arguing.

Priam listened from his throne, his hands folded in his lap, his face revealing nothing. Two men, both wealthy, both red-faced with righteous anger. The dispute was about grain—what else? Grain prices during siege.

"He's charging three times the market rate!" The first merchant, a man named Alcidamas, jabbed a finger at his rival. "Three times! The poor can't afford to eat!"

"The market rate was set before the siege." The second merchant, Phereus, spread his hands. "Costs have risen. Ships won't run the blockade for the old prices."

"You're hoarding! You have warehouses full—"

"I have warehouses that need to last through winter. Through next winter, if the walls hold that long."

They kept talking. Priam let them.

Finally, he raised his hand. Silence fell.

"The prices." His voice was quiet. The merchants leaned forward to hear. "Will stay fixed. At the pre-siege rate."

Phereus's face reddened. "My lord, that's—"

"Anyone who hoards will answer to me." Priam's voice hardened. "Anyone who charges more than the fixed rate will forfeit their stores to the crown. This is Troy. Not your counting house."

Phereus opened his mouth. Closed it.

"Leave."

The merchants left.

Priam stayed on his throne a moment longer, looking at the empty hall, the shadows lengthening across the floor. His hands trembled where they rested on the arms of the chair—the same hands that had built this city, that had held fifty sons and daughters, that had grown old and spotted while the walls remained young.

He was still king. He could still decide.

He rose, slowly, and went to find his generals. There were always more decisions to make.

---

## HECTOR

The sunset painted the walls of Troy the color of old blood.

Hector crossed the courtyard with his men's voices still ringing in his ears—the ragged cheer they'd raised when he called the retreat, the prayers muttered over the bodies of the fallen, the curses directed at the Greeks who had driven them back. Eight men dead. Twelve wounded. A handful of Greeks killed in return. The mathematics of attrition, playing out as it had played out for nine years.

His armor was heavy on his shoulders. The bronze cuirass, worked with the pattern of a charging lion. The greaves that strapped tight around his calves. The arm guards that had saved him from a spear-thrust three hours ago—the Greek's point had skidded across the bronze, leaving a bright scar in the patina of old blood and dust.

The blood on the armor was still wet. Some of it was his—a cut on his forearm, not deep, already crusting over. Most of it was not.

Andromache waited at the entrance to their chambers. Astyanax was in her arms, drowsy with the late hour, his head resting on her shoulder. The boy was dressed in a small tunic dyed Tyrian purple—a gift from Priam, fit for a prince. His feet were bare, his toes curling against his mother's hip.

Hector stopped at the threshold. He had not washed. Had not removed his armor. Had come straight from the walls because Andromache had sent word that she needed to see him, and when Andromache sent word, Hector came.

Astyanax looked up.

The boy's face shifted—the drowsy softness of a child about to smile, the eyes brightening with recognition—and then he saw the helmet.

The helmet his father wore to war. The bronze face with its empty eye-slits, the horsehair crest that made a man look twice his height, the metal that caught the dying light and threw it back as blood-red fire. A monster's face. A killer's face.

Astyanax screamed.

The sound echoed off the stone walls, high and thin and terrified. The scream of a child who sees a stranger where his father should be, who sees death standing in his mother's doorway wearing his father's body.

Hector did not move.

Astyanax was crying now, the screams giving way to heaving sobs, his small body shaking as he buried his face in Andromache's shoulder. His hands clutched at her dress, pulling it tight against her throat.

Andromache's eyes stayed on Hector. She did not speak. She did not need to.

Slowly, Hector reached up. Unbuckled the chin strap. Lifted the helmet from his head.

The bronze face stared up at nothing as he set it on the ground. The horsehair crest pooled in the dust like spilled wine.

"It's me," he said. His voice was rough, scraped raw by a day of shouting orders over the din of battle. "It's me, little one. Just me."

Astyanax peeked. One eye, then two, peering over Andromache's shoulder.

He saw his father's face. The face he knew—tired, dust-streaked, with lines around the eyes that hadn't been there a year ago. Not the monster. Not the bronze death-mask. Just his father.

The boy reached for him.

Hector took his son from Andromache's arms. Held him close, the small body pressed against the blood-crusted armor. Astyanax's hands found the edge of his cloak, the wool stiff with dried blood, and gripped it like a drowning man grips a rope.

"Don't go back out," Andromache said. "Not tonight."

"I have to."

"I know."

He looked at her. At the shadows under her eyes. At the grey that was threading through her dark hair, though she was not yet twenty-five. At the way she held herself, straight-backed, unbending, because if she bent she might break.

He looked at his son. At the small fingers still clutching his cloak. At the tears drying on the round cheeks.

He looked at the helmet on the ground. The empty eyes. The bronze face that had made his child scream.

"One more patrol," he said. "Then I'll come home."

He handed Astyanax back to Andromache. The boy whimpered, reached for him, tried to hold on to the cloak.

"Hector."

He stopped.

"Come home."

He picked up the helmet. Settled it on his head. The bronze closed around his face like a cage.

"I always do," he said.

He walked back toward the walls. The sunset was fading now, the blood-red light giving way to purple shadows. Behind him, his son started crying again.

## ODYSSEUS

The basin was bronze, old and dented, a veteran of ten years' campaigns.

Odysseus poured water from the pitcher and watched it fill the bowl. Clear water, cool from the cistern near the supply tents. He had drunk from that cistern his first week in the camp, back when Troy's walls seemed impossible and the war seemed like it might end by winter.

Nine years ago. Telemachus had been an infant then, small enough to hold in one hand. He would be—what now? Ten? Eleven? Odysseus had lost count somewhere around year six. The boy would be tall now. Would have learned to ride. Would have asked about his father, perhaps, and Penelope would have told him—what? That his father was a hero? That his father was clever? That his father did what needed to be done?

He put his hands in the water.

He had half expected it to turn red. Some sign of what he had done, some mark that the water would recognize even if men did not. He had picked up a stone—it was important to be seen participating, important that no one whisper that Odysseus of Ithaca had held back while the army did justice—but he had thrown it at the pit's edge, where the dirt was soft. The killing had been done by other hands. His own were clean.

The water stayed clear.

He lifted his hands, watched the droplets fall back into the basin. No blood. No stain. Just water and bronze and the lamplight flickering on the surface.

He dried his hands on a cloth. The cloth was rough, soldier's linen, nothing like the fine wool Penelope used to weave on her loom. He thought of her fingers moving through the warp and weft, the soft click of the heddles, the way she hummed while she worked. Old songs from her childhood. Songs about heroes and homecomings.

The trial had been just. The evidence had been clear. Palamedes was a traitor who had been caught and punished, and in a month no one would remember the details—only that justice had been done, that the army had protected itself, that the war would continue as it had always continued.

Odysseus lay down on his cot.

The canvas above him was still. Outside, the camp was settling into its evening routines—the clatter of cook pots, the low murmur of soldiers swapping stories, the occasional bark of laughter from the wine-tent. Somewhere a dog was barking. It barked twice, then fell silent.

He closed his eyes.

He waited for Palamedes's face to appear. For the calm voice to echo in the darkness: *You know what you are.* For the weight of the first stone in his palm, the arc of its flight, the sound it made when it struck.

Nothing came.

The darkness behind his eyes was empty. The silence in his tent was just silence. The thing he had done was done, and it seemed very far away now, as distant as Ithaca, as small as a stone thrown at the edge of a pit.

He thought of home. The olive tree that grew through the center of his bedchamber, the living wood he had built his marriage bed around. The harbor where his ships had rested before the war. The hillside where he had pretended to be mad, plowing salt into the earth while Palamedes watched.

He thought of Telemachus. Tried to picture what the boy looked like now—Penelope's dark hair, or his own? Her quiet patience, or his restlessness? Would the boy know him when he finally walked through the door? Would he know the boy?

The lamp guttered.

Odysseus slept.

He slept deeply, dreamlessly, the way he had not slept since the beach at Aulis. No ghost troubled him. No voice spoke in the darkness. No face appeared behind his eyes.

He slept well.

He had not expected to.

*End of Chapter Three*
