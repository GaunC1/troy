## ODYSSEUS

The camp slept.

Odysseus crossed between the tents, keeping to the shadows. The moon was thin. The watchfires had burned low. He lifted the flap of Palamedes's tent and slipped inside.

He stood a moment, letting his eyes adjust. Palamedes slept on a low cot, breathing evenly.

Odysseus moved to the bedding and slid the bag of gold beneath the blankets. Trojan gold—he'd set it aside weeks ago. Then he crossed to the document case and placed the letter inside, third from the top.

The letter had taken him three nights. Priam's seal, borrowed and returned. The handwriting close enough to a Trojan scribe's. Promises of gold. A Greek commander—unnamed. The gold would name him.

Odysseus looked at Palamedes sleeping.

Six years since the beach at Ithaca. *Remember that name,* he'd told Penelope. She'd asked why. He hadn't answered.

He left the tent. No one saw him go.

---

The assembly gathered at midmorning.

A soldier brought the letter forward. He'd found it, he said, near the Trojan lines. Dropped, perhaps. Or planted for a messenger who never came.

Agamemnon read it aloud. Promises of gold. A Greek commander offering to sabotage the siege. The seal of Priam.

"The signature is obscured," Agamemnon said. "But the traitor is among us."

Murmurs. Kings looking at each other.

"We should search the tents," Odysseus said. "All of them. To clear any suspicion."

Palamedes nodded. "I agree. Search mine first, if you like. I have nothing to hide."

They searched his tent. They found the gold.

Palamedes stood very still as they pulled the bag from beneath his bedding. His face went blank. Then his eyes moved across the assembly, found Odysseus.

Held.

"Take him," Agamemnon said. "Hold him for trial."

Guards stepped forward. Palamedes didn't resist. He let them bind his hands, let them lead him away.

His eyes stayed on Odysseus until he was out of sight.

## CASSANDRA

The vision came without warning.

Hands in darkness. Something heavy lifted, set down. The scrape of leather on canvas.

Then daylight, too bright. A circle of men. Mouths open, shouting, but she couldn't hear them. Only the sound of her own breathing and something else—a wet crack, like a melon splitting.

Copper on her tongue. Someone else's blood.

A face. Close. Too close. Teeth bared, not in anger—in effort. An arm drawing back. Something gray in the hand. The weight of it. The roughness of stone against palm.

Then the falling. Not her—someone else. Knees hitting dirt. Hands coming up too late. The sky wheeling overhead, wrong color, too white.

More wet sounds. The smell of opened things.

A voice, very quiet: *You know what you are.*

Then nothing. A pit. Flies already gathering.

She was on her knees on the walls of Troy, retching. Her hands were pressed against the stone. The stone was warm. She was alive.

She went to find her father.

---

Priam was in the war room with his generals. Maps on the table. Little wooden markers.

"Father."

He looked up. The generals shifted.

"The snake swallows its tail," she said. "Across the water."

"Cassandra."

"They eat their own." She pressed her palms against her eyes. The copper taste wouldn't leave. "One of them is hungry. One of them has been hungry for years."

"Who? The Greeks?"

She dropped her hands. Looked at the little wooden markers. Ships. Walls. Men reduced to carved wood.

"I don't know," she said. "I can never see the face. Only the hands."

Priam waved her away. "Get some rest."

She went.

## PARIS

The wine hall was in the lower city, far from the palace.

A fight had broken out near the bar when Paris arrived. Two soldiers, drunk, grappling over something. The owner watched from behind his counter, arms crossed, waiting for one of them to fall.

Paris stepped around them and found a table in the corner where the lamplight didn't reach.

The wine came in a clay cup, tasting of the barrel. He drained it and signaled for another.

At the next table, dice clattered.

"That's three in a row." A soldier scooped up coins. "You're cursed tonight, friend."

The merchant shrugged, tossed more bronze on the table. "Again."

"—so we come over the wall, right, and there's this old man with a pitchfork—" Another soldier, at another table, gesturing with his cup. "A pitchfork! Against Thessalian infantry! So Doros, he just—" The soldier mimed a thrust. His friends howled.

Paris signaled for a third cup. Here he was just another man with coin. Just a face in the corner, drinking alone.

A girl settled onto his knee. Dark hair, dark eyes.

"You're quiet," she said. "Most men who buy this much wine have more to say."

"I'm thinking."

"About what?"

He thought of Helen. The chambers where she sat alone. The silence that had grown too heavy to break.

"Nothing," he said.

The girl traced a finger along his jaw. "You're handsome. Rich, too, by your clothes. Why drink in a place like this?"

"I like the wine," he said.

Later, in a back room, the girl asked his name.

"Corythus," he said.

---

Dawn was coming when Paris walked the streets.

The city was quiet. A few merchants setting up stalls. A dog nosing through refuse. The sky turning grey in the east.

He could go to Helen. Walk into their chambers, wake her, say—

What? What could he possibly say?

He stopped at a corner. The palace rose above him, its stones catching the first light.

He should go back. He should try.

Paris turned and walked the other way.

## ODYSSEUS

The holding tent was at the edge of the camp, near the latrines. Two guards at the entrance. Torches burning low.

Odysseus dismissed the guards. They didn't question it. Everyone knew he and Palamedes had history.

Inside, Palamedes sat on the ground, hands bound behind him. He looked up when Odysseus entered.

Neither spoke.

Palamedes's face was calm. Almost curious.

"You could have just killed me," he said. "Years ago. A knife in the dark. An accident on the battlefield. Why this?"

Odysseus didn't answer.

"Because you wanted them to do it." Palamedes nodded slowly. "You wanted the whole army to throw stones. You wanted me to know it was you, and to know that no one would believe me."

Odysseus still said nothing.

"I'm going to die tomorrow," Palamedes said. "Or the day after. Whenever they hold the trial. And I'll die knowing exactly what happened, and exactly who did it, and I won't be able to prove any of it."

"No," Odysseus said. "You won't."

Palamedes smiled. It was a strange smile—almost admiring.

"You're going to win this war," he said. "Aren't you. Agamemnon will fail. Achilles will die. Ajax will go mad. But you. You'll find a way."

"Yes."

"And when you do, I want you to remember something."

Odysseus waited.

"You'll get home," Palamedes said. "Eventually. I've seen the way you look at the stars—always finding Ithaca. And you'll walk through your own door, and you'll hold your wife, and you'll meet your son as a man instead of an infant." He leaned forward, his bound hands shifting behind him. "And in that moment, I want you to remember what you are. Not what you tell yourself. Not the clever stories you've built. What you actually are."

He held Odysseus's gaze.

"The man who murdered his friend to win a game no one else was playing."

Odysseus stood very still. Then he turned and walked out of the tent.

The guards resumed their positions. The torches guttered in the night wind. Somewhere in the camp, a dog was barking.

Odysseus walked back to his tent.

He did not sleep.
