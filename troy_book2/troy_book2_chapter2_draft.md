## ODYSSEUS

The camp slept.

Odysseus crossed between the tents, keeping to the shadows. The moon was thin. The watchfires had burned low. He lifted the flap of Palamedes's tent and slipped inside.

He stood a moment, letting his eyes adjust. Palamedes slept on a low cot, breathing evenly.

Odysseus moved to the bedding and slid the bag of gold beneath the blankets. Trojan gold—he'd set it aside weeks ago. Then he crossed to the document case and placed the letter inside, third from the top.

The letter had taken him three nights. Priam's seal, borrowed and returned. The handwriting close enough to a Trojan scribe's. Promises of gold. A Greek commander—unnamed. The gold would name him.

Odysseus looked at Palamedes sleeping.

Six years since the beach at Ithaca. *Remember that name,* he'd told Penelope. She'd asked why. He hadn't answered.

He left the tent. No one saw him go.

---

The assembly gathered at midmorning.

A soldier brought the letter forward. He'd found it, he said, near the Trojan lines. Dropped, perhaps. Or planted for a messenger who never came.

Agamemnon read it aloud. Promises of gold. A Greek commander offering to sabotage the siege. The seal of Priam.

"The signature is obscured," Agamemnon said. "But the traitor is among us."

Murmurs. Kings looking at each other.

"We should search the tents," Odysseus said. "All of them. To clear any suspicion."

Palamedes nodded. "I agree. Search mine first, if you like. I have nothing to hide."

They searched his tent. They found the gold.

Palamedes stood very still as they pulled the bag from beneath his bedding. His face went blank. Then his eyes moved across the assembly, found Odysseus.

Held.

Agamemnon looked at the gold. Looked at the letter. He could ask questions—where the gold came from, why Palamedes would hide it so poorly, why the letter appeared now after six years of war.

He didn't ask.

Instead he stood taller. Squared his shoulders. When he spoke, his voice carried to every corner of the assembly.

"The evidence is clear. He will face judgment." He didn't look at Odysseus. "Take him. Hold him until the army decides his fate."

Guards stepped forward. Palamedes didn't resist. He let them bind his hands, let them lead him away.

His eyes stayed on Odysseus until he was out of sight.

## CASSANDRA

The vision came without warning.

Hands in darkness. Something heavy lifted, set down. The scrape of leather on canvas.

Then daylight, too bright. A circle of men. Mouths open, shouting, but she couldn't hear them. Only the sound of her own breathing and something else—a wet crack, like a melon splitting.

Copper on her tongue. Someone else's blood.

A face. Close. Too close. Teeth bared, not in anger—in effort. An arm drawing back. Something gray in the hand. The weight of it. The roughness of stone against palm.

Then the falling. Not her—someone else. Knees hitting dirt. Hands coming up too late. The sky wheeling overhead, wrong color, too white.

More wet sounds. The smell of opened things.

A voice, very quiet: *You know what you are.*

Then nothing. A pit. Flies already gathering.

She was on her knees on the walls of Troy, retching. Her hands were pressed against the stone. The stone was warm. She was alive.

She went to find her father.

---

Priam was in the war room with his generals. Maps on the table. Little wooden markers.

"Father."

He looked up. The generals shifted.

"The snake swallows its tail," she said. "Across the water."

"Cassandra."

"They eat their own." She pressed her palms against her eyes. The copper taste wouldn't leave. "One of them is hungry. One of them has been hungry for years."

"Who? The Greeks?"

She dropped her hands. Looked at the little wooden markers. Ships. Walls. Men reduced to carved wood.

"I don't know," she said. "I can never see the face. Only the hands."

Priam's hand rose toward her face—the old gesture, a father's touch. It stopped. Hung in the air. Fell to his side.

"Get some rest." He turned away before she did.

She didn't go to her chamber.

She found a scribe in the lower halls, an old man bent over tablets, recording grain stores.

"Write this down," she said. "Everything I've told you. The snake. The hands in darkness. The stoning."

The scribe looked up. His face went pale. "Princess, I can't—"

She pulled a gold ring from her finger. Pressed it into his palm. "Write it. Date it. Keep it somewhere safe. When it happens—when they find the body—you'll know I was right."

The scribe stared at the ring. At her. Finally, slowly, he nodded.

She left.

Later, she passed through the lower courtyard on her way to the walls. The scribe's room was empty. His tablets lay scattered on the floor, one of them broken in half.

She kept walking.

## BRISEIS

She woke to the sound of Achilles leaving the tent.

It was still dark. She heard him buckling his greaves, the soft clink of bronze on bronze. Then the tent flap lifting, falling. His footsteps fading toward the shore.

He did this sometimes. Walked the beach before dawn, alone. Patroclus had told her Achilles had done this since they were boys on Pelion, since before the war, since before everything. He needed the water. The sound of it.

She lay in the bed, the wool blanket still warm where he had been. The smell of him on the pillow—salt and leather and something else, something that had become familiar. Her body knew that smell now. Knew the weight of him, the rhythm of his breathing, the way he twitched in his sleep.

Three weeks since Lyrnessus. Or four.

She rose and dressed in the grey light. Her old dress was gone—Patroclus had found her a new one, Thessalian wool dyed the color of wine. "It belonged to someone," he'd said, and hadn't explained further.

There was water in the basin. She washed her face, her hands, the back of her neck. Cold water. She washed between her legs, quickly.

Achilles returned as the sun was rising. He stood in the entrance of the tent, his hair wet, his feet bare and sandy. He looked at her.

"You're awake."

"Yes."

He crossed to the armor stand, began checking the straps on his cuirass. His back was to her—the broad shoulders, the scars she knew by touch now. A puckered wound below his left shoulder blade. A long thin line across his ribs. A burn, old and faded, on his right arm. Her fingers had traced each of them in the dark.

"There's bread," she said. "And figs. Patroclus brought them last night."

"I'm not hungry."

She watched him work the leather straps. His hands were quick, practiced.

"Something's happening today," she said. "In the camp. The soldiers are talking about a trial."

His hands stilled. "Palamedes."

"Who is he?"

"A man who asks too many questions." He resumed his work on the armor. "He won't be asking them much longer."

He turned to face her. The morning light caught his eyes—grey, the color of the sea before a storm.

"Eat something," he said. "I'll be back before dark."

He left.

She sat on the edge of the bed, the bread untouched beside her. Outside, the camp was waking—voices, footsteps, the clang of bronze. Somewhere a horse whinnied. Somewhere a man was shouting orders.

She thought of Mynes. Tried to picture his face.

The features had gone soft, like something left in water too long. She could remember his hands, the merchant's rings. She could remember his voice. But the face—

She picked up the bread. Tore off a piece. Chewed.

The bread was good. Fresh. Patroclus must have traded something valuable for it.

She ate it all.

## PARIS

The practice yard was empty when Paris arrived.

Night. Torches set at intervals along the far wall. He'd bribed the guards to leave one burning at the hundred-pace mark.

He drew. Released. The arrow split the air, vanished into darkness. A moment later—the soft thunk of bronze finding wood.

He nocked another. Drew. Released.

Again. Again. Again.

His fingers bled where the string bit into old calluses. He kept shooting. When the torch finally guttered and died, he retrieved his arrows, counted them—all within a hand's breadth of the flame—and walked toward the lower city.

---

The wine hall was far from the palace.

A fight had broken out near the bar when Paris arrived. Two soldiers, drunk, grappling over something. The owner watched from behind his counter, arms crossed, waiting for one of them to fall.

Paris stepped around them and found a table in the corner where the lamplight didn't reach.

The wine came in a clay cup, tasting of the barrel. He drained it and signaled for another.

At the next table, dice clattered.

"That's three in a row." A soldier scooped up coins. "You're cursed tonight, friend."

The merchant shrugged, tossed more bronze on the table. "Again."

"—so we come over the wall, right, and there's this old man with a pitchfork—" Another soldier, at another table, gesturing with his cup. "A pitchfork! Against Thessalian infantry! So Doros, he just—" The soldier mimed a thrust. His friends howled.

Paris signaled for a third cup. Here he was just another man with coin. Just a face in the corner, drinking alone.

A girl settled onto his knee. Dark hair, dark eyes.

"You're quiet," she said. "Most men who buy this much wine have more to say."

"I'm thinking."

"About what?"

He thought of Helen. The chambers where she sat alone. The silence that had grown too heavy to break.

"Nothing," he said.

The girl traced a finger along his jaw. "You're handsome. Rich, too, by your clothes. Why drink in a place like this?"

"I like the wine," he said.

Later, in a back room, the girl asked his name.

"Corythus," he said.

She traced his fingers, the calluses. "These aren't from a sword."

He pulled his hand back. "No. They're not."

---

Dawn was coming when Paris walked the streets.

The city was quiet. A few merchants setting up stalls. A dog nosing through refuse. The sky turning grey in the east.

He could go to Helen. Walk into their chambers, wake her, say—

What? What could he possibly say?

He stopped at a corner. The palace rose above him, its stones catching the first light.

He should go back. He should try.

Paris turned and walked the other way.

## ODYSSEUS

The holding tent was at the edge of the camp, near the latrines. Two guards at the entrance. Torches burning low.

Odysseus dismissed the guards. They didn't question it. Everyone knew he and Palamedes had history.

Inside, Palamedes sat on the ground, hands bound behind him. He looked up when Odysseus entered.

Neither spoke.

Palamedes's face was calm. Almost curious.

"You could have just killed me," he said. "Years ago. A knife in the dark. An accident on the battlefield. Why this?"

Odysseus didn't answer.

"Because you wanted them to do it." Palamedes nodded slowly. "You wanted the whole army to throw stones. You wanted me to know it was you, and to know that no one would believe me."

Odysseus still said nothing.

"I'm going to die tomorrow," Palamedes said. "Or the day after. Whenever they hold the trial. And I'll die knowing exactly what happened, and exactly who did it, and I won't be able to prove any of it."

"No," Odysseus said. "You won't."

Palamedes smiled. It was a strange smile—almost admiring.

"You're going to win this war," he said. "Aren't you. Agamemnon will fail. Achilles will die. Ajax will go mad. But you. You'll find a way."

"Yes."

"And when you do, I want you to remember something."

Odysseus waited.

"You'll get home," Palamedes said. "Eventually. I've seen the way you look at the stars—always finding Ithaca. And you'll walk through your own door, and you'll hold your wife, and you'll meet your son as a man instead of an infant." He leaned forward, his bound hands shifting behind him. "And in that moment, I want you to remember what you are. Not what you tell yourself. Not the clever stories you've built. What you actually are."

He held Odysseus's gaze.

"The man who murdered his friend to win a game no one else was playing."

Odysseus stood very still. Then he turned and walked out of the tent.

The guards resumed their positions. The torches guttered in the night wind. Somewhere in the camp, a dog was barking.

Odysseus walked back to his tent.

He did not sleep.
