## ODYSSEUS

The camp slept.

Odysseus crossed between the tents, keeping to the shadows. The moon was thin. The watchfires had burned low. He lifted the flap of Palamedes's tent and slipped inside.

He stood a moment, letting his eyes adjust. Palamedes slept on a low cot, breathing evenly. A clever man. Perhaps the cleverest in the Greek camp, after Odysseus himself.

That was the problem.

Odysseus moved to the bedding and slid the bag of gold beneath the blankets. Trojan gold—he'd taken it from the last raid, set it aside for this. Then he crossed to the document case and placed the letter inside, third from the top, where it would be found but not too quickly.

The letter was good work. Priam's seal, borrowed and returned in a single night. The handwriting close enough to the king's scribe. Promises of gold for betrayal. A Greek commander—unnamed, but the gold would name him.

Odysseus looked at Palamedes sleeping.

Six years since the beach at Ithaca. *Remember that name,* he'd told Penelope. She'd asked why. He hadn't answered.

Palamedes asked too many questions. Noticed too much. The supply discrepancies, the reports that didn't quite add up. Eventually he would find something Odysseus couldn't explain away.

That was the reason Odysseus gave himself.

Odysseus left the tent. No one saw him go.

---

The assembly gathered at midmorning.

A soldier brought the letter forward—one of Odysseus's men, though no one knew that. He'd found it, he said, near the Trojan lines. Dropped, perhaps. Or planted for a messenger who never came.

Agamemnon read it aloud. The words hung in the air. Promises of gold. A Greek commander offering to sabotage the siege. The seal of Priam.

"The signature is obscured," Agamemnon said. "But the traitor is among us."

Murmurs through the assembly. Kings looking at each other.

"We should search the tents," Odysseus said. "All of them. To clear any suspicion."

Palamedes nodded. "I agree. Search mine first, if you like. I have nothing to hide."

They searched his tent. They found the gold.

Palamedes stood very still as they pulled the bag from beneath his bedding. His face went blank. Then his eyes moved across the assembly, found Odysseus.

He knew. Odysseus could see that he knew.

But knowing changed nothing.

---

The trial was brief.

Palamedes spoke well. He pointed out the convenience of the letter's appearance. The gold planted too neatly. The lack of any witness, any prior suspicion.

"Someone has done this to me," he said. "Someone in this camp. Ask yourselves who benefits from my death."

For a moment, Odysseus thought it might work. Palamedes was persuasive. The logic was sound.

Then Odysseus rose.

"I've known Palamedes for years," he said. "Served beside him. I don't want to believe this." He paused, let the silence stretch. "But the evidence is here. The gold was in his tent. The letter bears Priam's seal. And Palamedes—" Another pause. "Palamedes is clever enough to do exactly this. To treat with the enemy, to cover his tracks, to make us doubt even when the proof is before us."

He sat down.

The vote was close. But it fell against Palamedes.

---

They dug a pit outside the camp.

Palamedes walked to it without guards. He could have run. Where would he go?

The army ringed the pit, stones in their hands. Odysseus stood among them.

Palamedes looked at him. Quiet. Almost calm.

"You know what you are," he said.

Odysseus said nothing.

The first stone hit Palamedes in the shoulder. He stumbled but didn't fall. The second caught his chest. The third his head.

He fell.

The stones kept coming. Odysseus picked one up. Threw it. It was important to be seen participating.

When it was over, the thing in the pit was not recognizable as a man.

The army dispersed. Justice done. A traitor punished.

Odysseus stayed a moment. He expected to feel something.

He didn't.

## CASSANDRA

The vision came without warning.

She was walking the walls when it struck—a man in a pit, stones falling, Greeks in a ring around him. Not a battle. An execution.

She saw the man's face before the stones destroyed it. Saw his mouth moving. Saw the Greeks he had served beside throwing rocks until he stopped.

She saw another face. A man watching from the edge of the crowd. He had planted something in the dead man's tent. She saw him do it in the darkness, saw the careful placement, the forged letter.

The vision released her. She leaned against the wall, breathing.

Then she went to find her father.

---

Priam was in the war room with his generals. Maps spread on the table. Little wooden markers representing armies.

"Father."

He looked up. The generals shifted, uncomfortable. The mad princess. Why did she keep appearing?

"I had a vision. The Greeks have killed one of their own."

"Killed?" Priam frowned. "In battle?"

"Stoned him. In their camp. They accused him of treason, but he was innocent. One of their commanders framed him."

Priam considered this. Then he shrugged.

"Let them kill each other. It saves us trouble."

"You don't understand." Cassandra stepped forward. The generals edged back. "This is what they are. They can do this to their own people. They'll do it to us. To everyone."

"I understand perfectly." Priam's voice was patient, the tone he used with children and madwomen. "The Greeks are barbarians. We've always known this. If they want to murder each other, why should we care?"

Cassandra looked at her father. At his maps and markers. At his strategies that would not save them.

"The man who did this," she said. "He won't flinch when Troy falls. He's already killed someone who trusted him. We'll be easier."

Priam waved his hand. "Thank you, Cassandra. You may go."

She went.

Behind her, the generals returned to their maps. The little wooden markers stood in rows. One of them represented the Greek camp, where a body was being shoveled into an unmarked grave.

## PARIS

The wine hall was in the lower city, far from the palace. Paris had been there since afternoon.

The wine was rough and the company was rougher. Soldiers on leave, merchants between trades, men who didn't ask questions. Paris had found a table in the corner where the lamplight didn't reach.

A girl sat on his knee. Young. Pretty. Dark hair, dark eyes, a laugh that came too easily.

"You're quiet," she said. "Most men who buy this much wine have more to say."

"I'm thinking."

"About what?"

About Helen. About the chambers where she sat alone tonight, where she'd sat alone most nights for months. About the silence between them that had grown too heavy to break.

"Nothing," he said.

The girl traced a finger along his jaw. "You're handsome. Rich, too, by your clothes. Why drink in a place like this?"

Because no one knows me here. Because the palace is full of people who look at me and see the war. Because Helen looks at me and sees Menelaus's sword that should have killed me, and Hector's contempt, and ten thousand dead.

"I like the wine," he said.

Later, in a back room, the girl asked his name.

"Corythus," he said. A merchant's son he'd known as a child. Dead now, probably. Most of the people Paris had known were dead now.

The girl didn't question it. Why would she? He was just another man in a wine hall, lying about who he was.

---

Dawn was coming when Paris walked the streets.

The city was quiet. A few merchants setting up stalls. A dog nosing through refuse. The sky turning grey in the east.

He could go to Helen. Walk into their chambers, wake her, say—

What? What could he possibly say?

I'm sorry I stole you. I'm sorry I believed a goddess. I'm sorry you left your daughter for me and now we can't stand to be in the same room.

He stopped at a corner. The palace rose above him, its stones catching the first light.

He should go back. He should try.

Paris turned and walked the other way. Another wine hall was opening, lamps lit in the windows, the smell of bread and something cooking.

He went inside.

## ODYSSEUS

Night again. His tent.

Odysseus poured water into the basin. Watched it settle.

He put his hands in the water and washed them. Slowly, thoroughly, the way his mother had taught him.

The water stayed clear.

He'd expected—he didn't know what he'd expected. Redness. A stain that wouldn't come out. Something to mark what he'd done.

There was nothing. His hands were clean. They'd always been clean. He'd barely touched the stones. The execution was legal. Justified. Palamedes was a traitor.

The army believed it. The kings believed it. In a month, no one would remember the details. Just that there had been a traitor, and justice had been done.

Odysseus dried his hands.

He thought about home. Penelope at her loom. Telemachus—ten years old now. Or eleven. He'd lost count.

Would his son recognize him? Would he know his father's face?

It didn't matter. Odysseus would make it home. He always found a way.

He lay down on his cot and closed his eyes.

The face of Palamedes did not appear. No ghost troubled his sleep.

He slept well. He hadn't expected to.

In the morning, a servant would empty the basin. The water would pour out, clear as spring rain. There would be nothing strange to notice.

There was nothing strange at all.
