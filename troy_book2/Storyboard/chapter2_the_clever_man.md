# Chapter 2: "The Clever Man"

## POVs
1. Odysseus
2. Cassandra
3. Briseis
4. Paris
5. Odysseus (return)

## Summary
Odysseus frames Palamedes for treason. The chapter opens with Odysseus slipping into Palamedes's tent at night, planting forged letters and Trojan gold beneath his bedding. The morning assembly follows. They find the gold. Palamedes's eyes find Odysseus across the assembly. He knows. But knowing changes nothing. Guards bind his hands.

Intercut with Troy: Cassandra on the walls, struck by a vision—abstract, visceral. Copper on her tongue. Stone against palm. Flies gathering. She goes to Priam, speaks in riddles: "The snake swallows its tail. They eat their own." Priam waves her away.

Briseis wakes to Achilles leaving the tent before dawn. Weeks have passed. She knows his scars by touch now. She washes, dresses in a dead woman's clothes, watches him return from the beach. They speak briefly about the trial. When he leaves, she tries to picture Mynes's face. She can't. She eats the bread anyway.

Paris drifts through Troy's lower quarters. A wine hall. A girl on his knee. She asks his name. He lies: "Corythus." At dawn he walks the streets. He should go to Helen. He turns away from the palace instead.

The chapter ends with Odysseus visiting Palamedes in the holding tent. Palamedes predicts Odysseus will win the war, and when he finally gets home, he should remember what he is: "The man who murdered his friend to win a game no one else was playing." Odysseus walks back to his tent. He does not sleep.

### Scene 3: The Vision (Cassandra POV)
- The vision comes without warning.
- Hands in darkness. Something heavy lifted, set down. The scrape of leather on canvas.
- Daylight, too bright. A circle of men. The wet crack of something splitting.
- Copper on her tongue. Someone else's blood.
- A face too close. Teeth bared in effort. Stone against palm.
- The falling. Knees hitting dirt. Sky wheeling.
- A voice, very quiet: "You know what you are."
- A pit. Flies already gathering.
- She's on her knees on the walls of Troy, retching.

### Scene 4: The Dismissal (Cassandra POV)
- Priam in the war room. Maps. Little wooden markers.
- "The snake swallows its tail. Across the water."
- "They eat their own. One of them is hungry. One of them has been hungry for years."
- "I can never see the face. Only the hands."
- Priam waves her away. "Get some rest."

### Scene 5: The Routine (Briseis POV)
- She wakes to the sound of Achilles leaving the tent. Still dark.
- He walks the beach before dawn. Patroclus told her he's done this since they were boys.
- The wool blanket still warm where he had been. The smell of him on the pillow.
- Three weeks since Lyrnessus. Or four.
- Her old dress is gone. Patroclus found her a new one. "It belonged to someone."
- She washes her face, her hands. She washes between her legs, quickly.
- Achilles returns as the sun rises. Hair wet, feet bare and sandy.
- "You're awake." "Yes."
- His back to her—the scars she knows by touch now.
- "Something's happening today. The soldiers are talking about a trial."
- "Palamedes. A man who asks too many questions. He won't be asking them much longer."
- "Eat something. I'll be back before dark."
- He leaves.
- She thinks of Mynes. Tries to picture his face. The features have gone soft, like something left in water too long.
- She picks up the bread. Tore off a piece. Chewed.
- The bread was good. Fresh.
- She ate it all.

### Scene 6: The Wine Hall (Paris POV)
- A wine hall in the lower city, far from the palace.
- A fight near the bar. Two soldiers grappling. The owner waiting for one to fall.
- Paris finds a table in the corner where the lamplight doesn't reach.
- At the next table, dice clatter. "That's three in a row. You're cursed tonight, friend."
- Another table: "—so we come over the wall, right, and there's this old man with a pitchfork—"
- A girl settles onto his knee. Dark hair, dark eyes.
- "You're quiet. Most men who buy this much wine have more to say."
- He thinks of Helen. The chambers where she sits alone.
- "You're handsome. Rich, too, by your clothes. Why drink in a place like this?"
- "I like the wine."
- Later, in a back room, the girl asks his name.
- "Corythus," he says.

### Scene 7: The Dawn Walk (Paris POV)
- Dawn coming. Paris walks the streets alone.
- A few merchants setting up stalls. A dog nosing through refuse.
- He could go to Helen. Wake her, say—what?
- The palace rises above him, stones catching the first light.
- He should go back. He should try.
- Paris turns and walks the other way.

### Scene 8: The Holding Tent (Odysseus POV)
- Night. The holding tent at the edge of camp.
- Odysseus dismisses the guards.
- Palamedes sits on the ground, hands bound behind him.
- "You could have just killed me. Years ago. A knife in the dark. Why this?"
- "Because you wanted them to do it. You wanted me to know it was you, and to know that no one would believe me."
- "I'm going to die knowing exactly what happened, and I won't be able to prove any of it."
- "No. You won't."
- "You're going to win this war. Agamemnon will fail. Achilles will die. Ajax will go mad. But you. You'll find a way."
- "Yes."
- "And when you do, I want you to remember what you are. The man who murdered his friend to win a game no one else was playing."
- Odysseus walks back to his tent.
- He does not sleep.

## Key Moments
- Odysseus planting the gold, the careful mechanics of frame-up
- Palamedes's face when he understands, eyes finding Odysseus
- Cassandra's abstract vision: copper on her tongue, stone against palm
- "The snake swallows its tail. They eat their own."
- Briseis trying to picture Mynes's face. She can't.
- Paris lying about his name: "Corythus"
- "The man who murdered his friend to win a game no one else was playing"
- "He does not sleep."

## Thematic Threads
- **The mechanics of conspiracy**: The chapter shows each step as careful craft
- **Cassandra's impossible knowledge**: She sees what happened but can only speak in riddles
- **Briseis's fading memory**: Mynes's face slipping away. She eats Achilles's bread anyway.
- **Love as casualty**: Paris and Helen's romance has curdled. He lies about his name to a tavern girl.
- **Sleeplessness vs. clear conscience**: Odysseus awake tonight. After the execution, he'll sleep well.

## Chapter End
Odysseus lies down in his tent. He stares at the canvas above him. Palamedes's words echo. He does not sleep. Tomorrow the trial. The day after, the stones. Everything after this will be easier—but that's tomorrow. Tonight, he lies awake.
