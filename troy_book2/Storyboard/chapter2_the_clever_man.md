# Chapter 2: "The Clever Man"

## POVs
1. Odysseus
2. Cassandra
3. Paris
4. Odysseus (return)

## Summary
Odysseus frames Palamedes for treason and watches him stoned to death by the Greek army. This is the moral turning point of Odysseus's arc—the moment he crosses a line he cannot uncross. The chapter opens with Odysseus planting forged letters and Trojan gold in Palamedes's tent, then follows the accusation, the trial, and the execution. Odysseus tells himself it was necessary—Palamedes was too clever, knew too much, would have exposed secrets. But the truth is simpler: Odysseus hated him. Palamedes forced him to join the war by placing Telemachus in the path of his plow. Everything Odysseus has lost traces back to that moment. This is revenge, dressed as strategy.

Cassandra witnesses the execution in a vision—sees a man stoned by his own allies, the Greeks devouring themselves. She tells Priam, who dismisses it. Why should Troy care if Greeks murder Greeks? He cannot see that the capacity for this kind of betrayal is what makes them dangerous.

Paris drifts through the chapter in counterpoint. He's drinking, avoiding Helen, bedding a servant girl. The great love that launched a thousand ships has curdled into something they can barely look at. Helen sits alone in their chambers. Paris finds reasons not to return.

The chapter ends with Odysseus washing his hands in a basin. The water runs clear. He expected it to be red. He's fine with what he did. Everything after this will be easier.

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: The Planting (Odysseus POV)
- Night. Odysseus slips into Palamedes's tent while the camp sleeps
- He plants a bag of Trojan gold beneath Palamedes's bedding
- He places a forged letter—Priam's seal, promising gold for betrayal—in Palamedes's document case
- The forgery is perfect. Odysseus is good at this.
- Brief internal: the history between them
  - Palamedes came to Ithaca to recruit Odysseus
  - Odysseus feigned madness, plowing his fields with an ox and a donkey, sowing salt
  - Palamedes placed infant Telemachus in the plow's path
  - Odysseus swerved. His sanity proved. His peace destroyed.
- Odysseus tells himself this is strategy. Palamedes is too clever. Asks too many questions. Has noticed inconsistencies in the supply records, in Odysseus's reports, in the stories that don't add up.
- The truth: Odysseus simply hates him
- He leaves the tent unseen

### Scene 2: The Accusation (Odysseus POV)
- Morning. Assembly of the Greek kings
- A "concerned soldier" (Odysseus's man) brings forward the letter, claims he found it near the Trojan lines
- Agamemnon reads it aloud. Priam offering gold. A Greek commander promising to sabotage the siege.
- The signature is ambiguous—but the gold will be found in someone's tent
- Odysseus suggests a search. "For the good of the army. To clear all suspicion."
- Palamedes agrees readily—he has nothing to hide
- They search his tent. Find the gold.
- Palamedes's face. The moment he understands.
- His eyes find Odysseus across the assembly. He knows. But knowing changes nothing.

### Scene 3: The Trial (Odysseus POV)
- Palamedes defends himself. Eloquently. Logically.
- He points out the letter's convenient appearance. The gold planted too neatly.
- He almost convinces them.
- Odysseus speaks. Reluctantly. More in sorrow than anger.
- "I've known Palamedes for years. Served beside him. I don't want to believe this. But the evidence—"
- He lists Palamedes's access, his cleverness, his ability to do exactly this
- The same qualities that made Palamedes valuable now damn him
- The vote is close. But it falls against Palamedes.
- The sentence: death by stoning. The traditional punishment for traitors.

### Scene 4: The Stones (Odysseus POV)
- A pit dug outside camp. Palamedes led to it.
- He doesn't beg. Doesn't weep. He looks at Odysseus.
- "You know what you are," Palamedes says. Quiet. Almost conversational.
- Odysseus doesn't respond.
- The first stone hits Palamedes in the shoulder. The second in the chest.
- Odysseus picks up a stone. It's important to be seen participating.
- The stoning is not quick. It takes time.
- At the end, Palamedes is not recognizable.
- The army disperses. They were right to execute a traitor. Justice was done.
- Odysseus stays a moment. Looking at the body.
- He feels nothing. He expected to feel something.

### Scene 5: The Vision (Cassandra POV)
- Cassandra in her tower, struck by a vision
- She sees a man in a pit, stones falling. Greeks killing a Greek.
- She sees Odysseus watching. She sees the forged letter in his hand the night before.
- She sees what this means: the Greeks are capable of anything. They will destroy each other as readily as they destroy Troy.
- She goes to Priam. Tells him what she saw.
- Priam listens. Shrugs.
- "Let them kill each other. It saves us the trouble."
- Cassandra: "You don't understand. This is how they are. They'll do this to us too. To everyone."
- Priam: "I understand perfectly. The Greeks are barbarians. We've always known this."
- He returns to his maps, his plans, his strategies that will not save them.
- Cassandra leaves.
- She wanted him to see that the capacity for this kind of betrayal is what makes the Greeks dangerous. That a man who can murder his ally so cleanly will not flinch when Troy falls.
- But Priam sees only enemies killing enemies. Good news.

### Scene 6: The Curdled Love (Paris POV)
- Paris in a wine hall in Troy's lower quarters. Not the palace.
- He's been here since afternoon. The wine is rough. The company is rougher.
- A girl sits on his knee. Young. Pretty. Not Helen.
- He's thinking about Helen anyway.
- Internal: They barely speak now. She sits at her loom, or walks the walls, or helps in the healing tents. She doesn't look at him.
- When they're alone, the silence is worse than fighting.
- He should go back. He should talk to her. He should try to fix whatever broke.
- Instead he drinks. Instead he traces the girl's collarbone and thinks about a feast in Sparta six years ago.
- The girl asks his name. He lies. Says he's a merchant's son.
- Later: he walks the streets alone. Dawn is coming.
- He could go to Helen. Explain. Apologize for—for what? For everything?
- He turns away from the palace. Finds another wine hall opening for the morning trade.

### Scene 7: The Clean Water (Odysseus POV)
- Night. Odysseus in his tent.
- A basin of water. He washes his hands.
- He watches the water. Half expects it to turn red.
- It doesn't. The water runs clear.
- His hands are clean. They were always clean. He never threw a stone that mattered. The execution was legal. Justified. Palamedes was a traitor.
- Odysseus dries his hands.
- He thinks about home. About Penelope. About Telemachus, who must be—what, nine now? Ten?
- He wonders if he'll recognize his son when he finally returns.
- He sleeps well. He expected not to.
- Everything after this will be easier.

## Key Moments
- Odysseus planting the gold, the careful mechanics of frame-up
- Palamedes's face when he understands
- "You know what you are"
- Odysseus picking up a stone—the participation that implicates him
- Priam's dismissal: "Let them kill each other"
- Paris lying about his name to the girl
- The water running clear

## Thematic Threads
- **The turn**: This is where Odysseus crosses from pragmatist to something darker. He tells himself it's strategy. It's not. It's hate.
- **The clever man's trap**: Palamedes's own cleverness is used against him. The same logic that might have saved him is twisted into evidence of guilt.
- **Greek capacity for atrocity**: Cassandra sees what Priam cannot—the willingness to destroy their own makes them capable of anything.
- **Love as casualty**: Paris and Helen's romance has become its own kind of siege. The passion that started the war cannot survive it.
- **Clean hands**: The final image. Odysseus expected guilt. Found none. This is the horror.

## Chapter End
Odysseus dries his hands and lies down to sleep. He thinks briefly of home, of his wife and son growing up without him. Then he closes his eyes. The face of Palamedes does not appear. No ghost troubles him. He sleeps deeply, easily, the sleep of a man with nothing on his conscience. The water in the basin sits still and clear. In the morning, a servant will empty it without noticing anything strange. There is nothing strange to notice. Odysseus is fine with what he did. He will be fine with what comes next.
