# Chapter 2: "The Clever Man"

## POVs
1. Odysseus
2. Cassandra
3. Paris
4. Odysseus (return)

## Summary
Odysseus frames Palamedes for treason. The chapter opens with Odysseus slipping into Palamedes's tent at night, planting forged letters and Trojan gold beneath his bedding. The forgery is perfect—Priam's seal, promises of gold for a Greek commander willing to sabotage the siege. The handwriting is close enough to a Trojan scribe's. Odysseus has been practicing.

The morning assembly follows. A soldier brings forward the letter, claims he found it near the Trojan lines. Agamemnon reads it aloud. Odysseus suggests a search of the tents. Palamedes agrees readily—he has nothing to hide. They find the gold. Palamedes's face changes as he understands. His eyes find Odysseus across the assembly. He knows. But knowing changes nothing. Guards bind his hands. The trial will come tomorrow.

Intercut with Troy: Cassandra on the walls, struck by a vision. Abstract, visceral—hands in darkness, something heavy set down, the scrape of leather on canvas. Then daylight too bright, a circle of men, mouths open shouting but no sound. The wet crack of something splitting. Copper on her tongue. Someone else's blood. A face too close, teeth bared in effort. Stone against palm. The falling—not her, someone else. Knees hitting dirt. Sky wheeling. Wet sounds. Flies gathering. She goes to Priam, speaks in riddles: "The snake swallows its tail. They eat their own. One of them is hungry. One of them has been hungry for years." Priam waves her away.

Paris drifts through Troy's lower quarters. A wine hall far from the palace. A fight at the bar. Dice games. A girl on his knee. She asks his name. He lies: "Corythus." At dawn he walks the streets. He should go to Helen. Explain. Apologize. He turns away from the palace instead.

The chapter ends with Odysseus visiting Palamedes in the holding tent. Palamedes is bound, calm, almost curious. He asks why Odysseus didn't just kill him years ago—a knife in the dark, an accident on the battlefield. Why this? Odysseus doesn't answer. Palamedes answers for him: "Because you wanted them to do it. You wanted me to know it was you, and to know that no one would believe me." He predicts Odysseus will win the war—Agamemnon will fail, Achilles will die, Ajax will go mad—but Odysseus will find a way. And when he finally gets home, holds his wife, meets his son as a man, he should remember what he is: "The man who murdered his friend to win a game no one else was playing." Odysseus walks back to his tent. He does not sleep.

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: The Planting (Odysseus POV)
- Night. The camp sleeps. Odysseus slips into Palamedes's tent.
- He stands a moment, letting his eyes adjust. Palamedes sleeps evenly on a low cot.
- He slides the bag of gold beneath the blankets. Trojan gold—set aside weeks ago.
- He places the forged letter in the document case. Third from the top.
- The letter took him three nights. Priam's seal, borrowed and returned. The handwriting close enough.
- He looks at Palamedes sleeping.
- Six years since the beach at Ithaca. "Remember that name," he'd told Penelope. She'd asked why. He hadn't answered.
- He leaves the tent unseen.

### Scene 2: The Accusation (Odysseus POV)
- Morning. Assembly of the Greek kings.
- A soldier brings forward the letter. Found near the Trojan lines. Dropped, perhaps. Or planted for a messenger who never came.
- Agamemnon reads it aloud. Promises of gold. A Greek commander offering to sabotage the siege. Priam's seal.
- "The signature is obscured. But the traitor is among us."
- Murmurs. Kings looking at each other.
- Odysseus: "We should search the tents. All of them. To clear any suspicion."
- Palamedes nods: "I agree. Search mine first, if you like. I have nothing to hide."
- They search his tent. They find the gold.
- Palamedes stands very still. His face goes blank. Then his eyes move across the assembly, find Odysseus.
- Held.
- "Take him," Agamemnon says. "Hold him for trial."
- Guards bind his hands. He doesn't resist.
- His eyes stay on Odysseus until he's out of sight.

### Scene 3: The Vision (Cassandra POV)
- The vision comes without warning.
- Hands in darkness. Something heavy lifted, set down. The scrape of leather on canvas.
- Daylight, too bright. A circle of men. Mouths open, shouting, but she can't hear them. Only her own breathing and something else—a wet crack, like a melon splitting.
- Copper on her tongue. Someone else's blood.
- A face. Close. Too close. Teeth bared, not in anger—in effort. An arm drawing back. Something gray in the hand. The weight of it. The roughness of stone against palm.
- The falling. Not her—someone else. Knees hitting dirt. Hands coming up too late. The sky wheeling overhead, wrong color, too white.
- More wet sounds. The smell of opened things.
- A voice, very quiet: "You know what you are."
- Then nothing. A pit. Flies already gathering.
- She's on her knees on the walls of Troy, retching. Her hands pressed against warm stone. She's alive.
- She goes to find her father.

### Scene 4: The Dismissal (Cassandra POV)
- Priam in the war room with his generals. Maps. Little wooden markers.
- "Father."
- He looks up. The generals shift.
- "The snake swallows its tail," she says. "Across the water."
- "Cassandra."
- "They eat their own." She presses her palms against her eyes. The copper taste won't leave. "One of them is hungry. One of them has been hungry for years."
- "Who? The Greeks?"
- She drops her hands. Looks at the little wooden markers. Ships. Walls. Men reduced to carved wood.
- "I don't know. I can never see the face. Only the hands."
- Priam waves her away. "Get some rest."
- She goes.

### Scene 5: The Wine Hall (Paris POV)
- A wine hall in the lower city, far from the palace.
- A fight near the bar when Paris arrives. Two soldiers, drunk, grappling. The owner watches from behind the counter, waiting for one to fall.
- Paris steps around them. Finds a table in the corner where the lamplight doesn't reach.
- Wine in a clay cup, tasting of the barrel. He drains it, signals for another.
- At the next table, dice clatter.
- "That's three in a row." A soldier scoops up coins. "You're cursed tonight, friend."
- The merchant shrugs, tosses more bronze on the table. "Again."
- Another table, another soldier: "—so we come over the wall, right, and there's this old man with a pitchfork—a pitchfork! Against Thessalian infantry! So Doros, he just—" The soldier mimes a thrust. His friends howl.
- Paris signals for a third cup. Here he's just another man with coin.
- A girl settles onto his knee. Dark hair, dark eyes.
- "You're quiet. Most men who buy this much wine have more to say."
- "I'm thinking."
- "About what?"
- He thinks of Helen. The chambers where she sits alone. The silence too heavy to break.
- "Nothing."
- The girl traces a finger along his jaw. "You're handsome. Rich, too, by your clothes. Why drink in a place like this?"
- "I like the wine."
- Later, in a back room, the girl asks his name.
- "Corythus," he says.

### Scene 6: The Dawn Walk (Paris POV)
- Dawn coming. Paris walks the streets alone.
- A few merchants setting up stalls. A dog nosing through refuse. The sky turning grey.
- He could go to Helen. Walk into their chambers, wake her, say—
- What? What could he possibly say?
- The palace rises above him, stones catching the first light.
- He should go back. He should try.
- Paris turns and walks the other way.

### Scene 7: The Holding Tent (Odysseus POV)
- Night. The holding tent at the edge of camp, near the latrines.
- Two guards at the entrance. Torches burning low.
- Odysseus dismisses the guards. They don't question it. Everyone knows he and Palamedes have history.
- Inside, Palamedes sits on the ground, hands bound behind him. He looks up when Odysseus enters.
- Neither speaks.
- Palamedes's face is calm. Almost curious.
- "You could have just killed me. Years ago. A knife in the dark. An accident on the battlefield. Why this?"
- Odysseus doesn't answer.
- "Because you wanted them to do it." Palamedes nods slowly. "You wanted the whole army to throw stones. You wanted me to know it was you, and to know that no one would believe me."
- Odysseus says nothing.
- "I'm going to die tomorrow. Or the day after. Whenever they hold the trial. And I'll die knowing exactly what happened, and exactly who did it, and I won't be able to prove any of it."
- "No. You won't."
- Palamedes smiles. Strange—almost admiring.
- "You're going to win this war. Aren't you. Agamemnon will fail. Achilles will die. Ajax will go mad. But you. You'll find a way."
- "Yes."
- "And when you do, I want you to remember something."
- Odysseus waits.
- "You'll get home. Eventually. I've seen the way you look at the stars—always finding Ithaca. And you'll walk through your own door, and you'll hold your wife, and you'll meet your son as a man instead of an infant." He leans forward. "And in that moment, I want you to remember what you are. Not what you tell yourself. Not the clever stories you've built. What you actually are."
- He holds Odysseus's gaze.
- "The man who murdered his friend to win a game no one else was playing."
- Odysseus stands very still. Then turns and walks out of the tent.
- The guards resume their positions. The torches gutter in the night wind. Somewhere a dog barks.
- Odysseus walks back to his tent.
- He does not sleep.

## Key Moments
- Odysseus planting the gold, the careful mechanics of frame-up
- "Remember that name"—callback to Book 1
- Palamedes's face when he understands, eyes finding Odysseus
- Cassandra's abstract vision: copper on her tongue, stone against palm, flies gathering
- "The snake swallows its tail. They eat their own."
- Paris lying about his name: "Corythus"
- Palamedes: "The man who murdered his friend to win a game no one else was playing"
- "He does not sleep."

## Thematic Threads
- **The mechanics of conspiracy**: The chapter shows each step—the planting, the "discovery," the accusation—as careful craft
- **Cassandra's impossible knowledge**: She sees what happened but can only speak in riddles. The vision is physical, visceral, but the message is lost in translation.
- **Love as casualty**: Paris and Helen's romance has curdled. He lies about his name to a tavern girl. The silence in their chambers is worse than fighting.
- **The confrontation**: Palamedes gets to say what he knows. It changes nothing. He'll die anyway. But Odysseus heard him.
- **Sleeplessness vs. clear conscience**: The chapter ends with Odysseus awake. In Chapter 3, after the execution, he'll sleep well. The progression matters.

## Chapter End
Odysseus walks back to his tent in the dark. The guards resume their positions. The torches gutter. A dog barks somewhere in the camp. Inside his tent, Odysseus lies down. He stares at the canvas above him. Palamedes's words echo: "The man who murdered his friend to win a game no one else was playing." He does not sleep. Tomorrow the trial. The day after, the stones. Everything after this will be easier—but that's tomorrow. Tonight, he lies awake. He hadn't expected to.
