## Summary
The trial and execution of Palamedes, witnessed from multiple angles.

Briseis watches from the edge of the crowd—weeks into her captivity now, she knows the camp's rhythms and politics. The smell of salt and smoke and unwashed men. She knows which kings hate each other, knows Achilles barely leaves his tent, knows Patroclus brings him food. She watches the trial without understanding what's happening. A man stands before the assembly. Another man speaks against him. The vote falls.

The trial itself: Palamedes defends himself, points out the convenience of the evidence, names his history with Odysseus—the beach at Ithaca, the plow, the infant in the furrow. "Ask yourselves who benefits from my death." Odysseus counters: "Who benefits from his doubt? Who benefits if we look at proof and call it trickery?" The vote falls against Palamedes by seven.

The stoning follows. Briseis watches from the edge. The sounds. The flies gathering. She walks back to Achilles's tent. She can't picture Mynes's face anymore. But she can picture Achilles. Every line of him.

Intercut with Troy: Helen in the healing house—a temple once, now full of pallets and blood. Surgery without anesthetic. She holds men down while healers cut. A Trojan healer speaks to her for the first time: "You're good at this." "I've had practice." "It doesn't make up for anything." "I know."

Hector returns from a skirmish, armor bloody. Astyanax screams at his helmet—the bronze face, the horsehair crest. The boy doesn't recognize his father. Hector removes the helmet, holds his son. "Don't go back out." "I have to." "I know." He walks back toward the walls. Behind him, his son starts crying again.

The chapter ends with Odysseus washing his hands. The water runs clear. He thinks of home—the olive tree he built his marriage bed around, Penelope at her loom. He sleeps well. He hadn't expected to.

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: The Crowd (Briseis POV)
- The smell of the Greek camp: salt and smoke and unwashed men.
- Briseis has learned to breathe through her mouth. She has learned many things.
- She knows which paths to take to avoid the Locrian soldiers.
- She knows which kings hate each other. Most hate Agamemnon.
- Ajax the Greater and Ajax the Lesser share a name and nothing else.
- Diomedes and Odysseus eat together most evenings, heads bent close.
- She knows Achilles barely leaves his tent. Patroclus brings him food.
- Today is different. Men gathering near the assembly ground. Voices raised.
- She moves closer. Stays at the edge. A captive is invisible if she's quiet.
- A man stands before the assembly, hands bound. She doesn't know his name.
- His face is still.
- "A letter appears from nowhere. Found near the Trojan lines—but no one saw who dropped it."
- "If I were taking Trojan gold, would I hide it in my own tent?"
- The great kings on their stools: Agamemnon in purple, Nestor with his white beard, Diomedes scarred, Menelaus sitting apart.
- A soldier near Briseis mutters: "Makes sense. If you're going to betray the army, you don't leave the evidence lying about."
- "Ask yourselves who benefits from my death."

### Scene 2: The Trial (Odysseus POV)
- Palamedes has demanded his bonds removed. His right as a king's son.
- The leather cords lie in the dust, coiled like shed snakeskin.
- "The gold was planted. The letter is a forgery."
- Heads nodding. Near the front, Diomedes leans to murmur something to Ajax.
- Palamedes names his history with Odysseus. The beach at Ithaca. The ox and donkey. The salt instead of seed. The infant in the path of the plow.
- "He swerved. His sanity was proved. He has never forgiven me."
- Odysseus rises.
- "I have known Palamedes for nine years. I do not want to believe this."
- "But the evidence is here. The gold was in his tent. The letter bears Priam's seal."
- "Palamedes asks who benefits from his death. I ask: who benefits from his doubt? Who benefits if we look at proof and call it trickery?"
- "Palamedes is clever. Clever enough to make us doubt even when the proof is before us."
- The vote is called. It falls against Palamedes by seven.

### Scene 3: The Stones (Briseis POV)
- A pit dug outside the camp, near the horse lines.
- Briseis follows the crowd. No one stops her. No one sees her.
- The pit is not deep—perhaps to a man's waist.
- Soldiers picking up stones from the mound. Testing their weight.
- Palamedes at the pit's lip. His face calm.
- His eyes find someone across the crowd. Held.
- His lips move: "You know what you are."
- The first stone hits his shoulder. He stumbles.
- The sounds: steady, rhythmic, like rain on a roof. And under it, the sounds of impact.
- He's on his knees. Blood running into his eyes.
- The sounds stop.
- The crowd disperses. Briseis stays a moment longer, watching the flies gather.
- They can do this to their own, she thinks. They can do anything.
- She walks back to Achilles's tent.
- She can't picture Mynes's face anymore. But she can picture Achilles. Every line of him.
- She goes to fetch water from the cistern.
- She doesn't look back.

### Scene 4: The Healing House (Helen POV)
- The healing house had been a temple once.
- Columns at the entrance. Faded paint on the walls—Asclepius with his snake-wound staff.
- The altar moved to make room for pallets. The smell of incense replaced by blood and wound-wash.
- Helen holds a soldier down while the healer works.
- He's young, barely more than a boy. Downy cheeks. Eyes rolling white.
- The healer's bronze knife moves. Something grates against metal.
- "There." An arrowhead, dark with blood. It clinks into a bowl with others—the day's harvest.
- The soldier passes out. "Next."
- Helen washes her hands. The water is warm, rust-colored.
- One of the Trojan healers, a young woman with tired eyes: "You're good at this. You have steady hands."
- "I've had practice."
- "It doesn't make up for anything."
- Helen holds the gaze. "I know."
- The woman nods. Returns to work. Not forgiveness—but something. Acknowledgment.
- Another soldier carried in. Arrow wound in the shoulder, fletching bright with blood.
- Helen moves to hold him down.

### Scene 5: The Helmet (Hector POV)
- The sunset paints the walls of Troy the color of old blood.
- Hector crosses the courtyard. Eight men dead. Twelve wounded. A handful of Greeks killed in return.
- His armor heavy. The bronze cuirass with its charging lion. Greaves strapped tight. Arm guards that saved him from a spear-thrust three hours ago—the Greek's point left a bright scar in the patina.
- The blood on the armor still wet. Some his. Most not.
- Andromache at the entrance to their chambers. Astyanax in her arms, drowsy.
- The boy's face shifts—about to smile—then he sees the helmet.
- The bronze face. The horsehair crest. The empty eye-slits.
- Astyanax screams.
- The sound echoes off the stone walls. The scream of a child who sees a stranger where his father should be.
- Andromache's eyes stay on Hector. She doesn't speak.
- He unbuckles the chin strap. Lifts the helmet. Sets it on the ground.
- "It's me. Just me."
- The boy peeks. Sees his father's face. Reaches for him.
- Hector takes his son. The small hands grip his cloak, stiff with dried blood.
- "Don't go back out. Not tonight."
- "I have to."
- "I know."
- He looks at her. At the shadows under her eyes. At the grey threading through her dark hair.
- "One more patrol. Then I'll come home."
- He hands Astyanax back. "Hector." He stops. "Come home."
- He picks up the helmet. Settles it on his head. The bronze closes around his face.
- "I always do."
- He walks toward the walls. Behind him, his son starts crying again.

### Scene 6: Clean Water (Odysseus POV)
- The basin is bronze, old and dented, a veteran of ten years' campaigns.
- Odysseus pours water and watches it fill the bowl. Clear water, cool from the cistern.
- Nine years ago. Telemachus had been an infant. He would be—what now? Ten? Eleven?
- He puts his hands in the water.
- He had half expected it to turn red.
- It doesn't. The water stays clear.
- He threw a stone—it was important to be seen—but he threw it at the pit's edge.
- The killing was done by other hands. His own are clean.
- He dries them on rough soldier's linen.
- He thinks of Penelope. Her fingers in the warp and weft. The click of the heddles. Old songs about heroes and homecomings.
- The trial was just. The evidence was clear. In a month, no one will remember the details.
- He lies down.
- He thinks of home. The olive tree that grew through the center of his bedchamber. The harbor where his ships had rested.
- He closes his eyes.
- He waits for Palamedes's face to appear. For the voice: "You know what you are."
- Nothing comes.
- The darkness behind his eyes is empty.
- The lamp gutters.
- Odysseus sleeps. Deeply. Dreamlessly.
- He sleeps well.
- He had not expected to.

## Key Moments
- Briseis watching from the edge, invisible
- Palamedes: "Ask yourselves who benefits from my death"
- Odysseus: "Who benefits from his doubt?"
- "You know what you are"
- The flies gathering
- "They can do this to their own. They can do anything."
- Helen holding down a screaming soldier. "It doesn't make up for anything." "I know."
- Astyanax screaming at his father's helmet
- "Come home." "I always do."
- The water running clear
- "He sleeps well. He hadn't expected to."

## Thematic Threads
- **Parallel violence**: The stoning, the surgery, the skirmish. Violence everywhere, in different forms.
- **Women watching**: Briseis witnesses the execution, Helen participates in surgery, Andromache watches her husband leave.
- **Clean hands**: Odysseus's hands are clean. Helen's hands are red. Both have blood on them. One admits it.
- **Fathers and sons**: Astyanax doesn't recognize his father. The helmet makes Hector a monster.
- **Briseis's fading memory**: She can't picture Mynes. She can picture Achilles.

## Chapter End
Odysseus sleeps well, the basin of clear water beside him. Across the sea, Helen lies awake listening to the wounded. Hector lies beside Andromache, staring at the ceiling until dawn. Three people. Three silences. The war continues.
