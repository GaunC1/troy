# Chapter 3: "The Trial"

## POVs
1. Briseis
2. Odysseus
3. Helen
4. Hector
5. Odysseus (return)

## Summary
The trial and execution of Palamedes, witnessed from multiple angles. Briseis, now weeks into her captivity, has begun to learn the Greek camp's rhythms and politics. She watches the trial from the edge of the crowd—understanding that something important is happening, not yet understanding what. Odysseus speaks against Palamedes, turning his virtues into evidence of guilt. The vote falls. The execution follows.

Intercut with the Greek camp, we see Helen in Troy working in the healing house—surgery without anesthetic, holding men down while healers cut. She has made herself useful. It doesn't make up for anything, but it's what she can do.

Hector returns from a skirmish. Astyanax screams at his bloody armor—the boy doesn't recognize his father in the bronze. Hector removes the helmet, holds his son. Andromache asks him not to go back out. He says he has to. She knew he would say that.

The chapter ends with Odysseus alone in his tent, washing his hands. The water runs clear. He sleeps well. He hadn't expected to.

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: The Crowd (Briseis POV)
- Morning in the Greek camp. Something is happening.
- Briseis has been watching. Weeks now. Learning faces, factions, rhythms.
- She knows Achilles barely leaves his tent. Knows Patroclus brings him food.
- She knows the kings meet in Agamemnon's tent. Knows who hates whom.
- Today is different. Men gathering near the central area. Voices raised.
- She moves closer. Stays at the edge. A captive, invisible.
- A man stands before the assembly, hands bound. She doesn't know his name.
- Another man is speaking against him. Calm, reasonable, reluctant.
- She watches the faces in the crowd. Some doubt. Some conviction. Some just want it over.

### Scene 2: The Trial (Odysseus POV)
- Palamedes stands before the assembly, unbound now—his right as a king's son.
- He speaks his defense. Points out the convenience of the evidence. The gold hidden in the obvious place. The letter with the smudged signature.
- "A letter appears from nowhere. Found near the Trojan lines—but no one saw who dropped it."
- "If I were taking Trojan gold, would I hide it in my own tent? Would I leave it where a child could find it?"
- He names his history with Odysseus. The beach at Ithaca. The plow. The infant in the furrow.
- "Ask yourselves who benefits from my death."
- The assembly murmurs. Doubt spreading.
- Odysseus rises.
- "I've known Palamedes for years. Served beside him. I don't want to believe this."
- He pauses. Lets the silence work.
- "But the evidence is here. The gold was in his tent. The letter bears Priam's seal."
- Another pause.
- "Palamedes is clever. Clever enough to do exactly this—to treat with the enemy, to cover his tracks, to make us doubt even when the proof is before us."
- He sits. The vote is called. It falls against Palamedes.

### Scene 3: The Stones (Briseis POV)
- A pit dug outside the camp.
- Briseis follows the crowd. No one stops her. No one sees her.
- The bound man stands at the edge of the pit. He isn't fighting.
- The army rings the pit, stones in their hands.
- The bound man looks across the crowd. Finds someone. Holds the gaze.
- He says something. Briseis can't hear it from where she stands.
- The first stone hits his shoulder. He stumbles.
- The stones keep coming. The sound of them hitting flesh.
- Briseis watches. She has seen death before—her city, her brothers, her husband. But this is different. This is ritual. This is Greeks killing their own.
- When it's over, the thing in the pit is not recognizable.
- The crowd disperses. Briseis stays a moment, looking at what they've done.
- She thinks: They can do this to their own. They can do anything.

### Scene 4: The Healing House (Helen POV)
- Troy. The healing house that was once a temple.
- Helen holds a soldier down while the healer cuts. No anesthetic. Just hands and force.
- The soldier screams. Thrashes. She leans her weight on his shoulders.
- The healer works quickly. Removes something—an arrowhead, a shard of bone. Blood everywhere.
- The soldier passes out. The healer moves to the next patient.
- Helen washes her hands in a basin. The water turns red.
- A young woman—one of the Trojan healers—watches her.
- "You're good at this," the woman says.
- "I've had practice."
- "It doesn't make up for anything."
- Helen looks at her. "I know."
- The woman nods. Returns to work. Not forgiveness—but something. Acknowledgment.
- Helen moves to the next patient. Another wound. Another scream. Another day.

### Scene 5: The Helmet (Hector POV)
- Dusk. Hector returns from a skirmish—nothing major, a probing attack on the Greek lines.
- His armor is bloody. Some of it his. Most of it not.
- Andromache meets him in the courtyard. Astyanax in her arms.
- The boy sees his father. Starts to smile. Then sees the helmet—the bronze face, the horsehair crest.
- Astyanax screams. Turns away, burying his face in Andromache's shoulder.
- Hector stops. The boy's screams echo off the stone walls.
- Andromache's face. She doesn't say anything. She doesn't have to.
- Hector removes the helmet. Sets it on the ground. Holds out his hands.
- "It's me," he says. "Just me."
- The boy peeks. Sees his father's face. Reaches for him.
- Hector takes his son. Holds him close. The boy's small hands grip his bloody cloak.
- "Don't go back out," Andromache says. "Not tonight."
- "I have to."
- "I know."
- He looks at his son. At his wife. At the helmet on the ground, the bronze face staring up at nothing.
- "One more patrol. Then I'll come home."
- He hands Astyanax back to Andromache. Picks up the helmet. Walks back toward the walls.
- Behind him, his son starts crying again.

### Scene 6: Clean Water (Odysseus POV)
- Night. Odysseus's tent.
- A basin of water. He washes his hands.
- He watches the water. Half expects it to turn red.
- It doesn't. Clear as spring rain.
- His hands are clean. They've always been clean. He barely touched the stones.
- The execution was legal. Justified. Palamedes was a traitor.
- The army believes it. The kings believe it. In a month, no one will remember the details.
- He dries his hands.
- Thinks of home. Penelope at her loom. Telemachus—eleven now? Twelve? He's lost count.
- He lies down. Closes his eyes.
- The face of Palamedes does not appear.
- He sleeps well. He hadn't expected to.

## Key Moments
- Palamedes's defense: "Ask yourselves who benefits from my death"
- Odysseus's counter: "Clever enough to do exactly this"
- Briseis watching the stoning, invisible at the edge of the crowd
- "They can do this to their own. They can do anything."
- Helen holding down a screaming soldier, the water turning red
- Astyanax screaming at his father's helmet
- The water running clear in Odysseus's basin

## Thematic Threads
- **Parallel violence**: The stoning in the Greek camp, the surgery in Troy, the skirmish at the walls. Violence everywhere, in different forms.
- **Women watching**: Briseis witnesses the execution, Helen participates in surgery, Andromache watches her husband leave. All trapped, all adapting.
- **Clean hands**: Odysseus's hands are clean. Helen's hands are red. Both have blood on them. One admits it.
- **Fathers and sons**: Astyanax doesn't recognize his father. The helmet makes Hector a monster. What is this war doing to them?

## Chapter End
Odysseus sleeps well in his tent, the basin of clear water beside him. Across the sea, in Troy, Helen lies awake listening to the sounds of the wounded in the healing house below. In the palace, Hector lies beside Andromache, his son finally asleep between them, and stares at the ceiling until dawn.

Three people. Three silences. The war continues.
