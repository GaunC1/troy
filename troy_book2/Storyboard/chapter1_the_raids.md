## Summary
The chapter opens in Lyrnessus, a Trojan ally city, on what will be its last morning. Briseis is at breakfast with her husband Mynes when her younger brother Epistrophus arrives. A casual conversation about a Syrian glass merchant at the market turns into an argument about the Greek raids—Epistrophus thinks they're safe, Briseis points out that Pedasus and Thebe were "fine" too. Mynes tries to calm her, but she won't be calmed. The argument ends unresolved when Epistrophus leaves for the market, promising to bring her figs. Mynes softens, offers to send the horses to her mother's village tomorrow. A quiet moment—then the horns sound.

The perspective shifts to Achilles approaching Lyrnessus with his Myrmidons. The raid is efficient, brutal, joyless. Achilles kills without knowing names. The city falls in hours.

We return to Briseis in shock. She's pulled from the cellar. Sees her brother's body by a tower—young, thin, that wisp of beard. Sees her husband's body near the gates—merchant's rings on his fingers. She keeps walking. Outside the walls, she is sorted with other women, appraised, given to Achilles. A Greek with cold eyes points at her. She is put on a wagon, watches the city burn.

In Troy, Hector receives the refugees from Lyrnessus—seven people, all that escaped. Andromache tells him Astyanax took his first steps today. He missed it. She mentions the refugees say Achilles doesn't take ransoms anymore. Just kills.

Brief scene with Odysseus in the supply tent, overseeing the division of spoils. He sets aside a bag of gold with Trojan markings and a seal ring with Priam's crest. No explanation given.

The chapter ends with Briseis alone in Achilles's tent. He sits on the edge of the bed, staring at nothing. She watches him. She thinks: Tomorrow he'll do this to another city. And another. I'm going to be here for all of it. She closes her eyes. When she opens them again, it's dawn, and Achilles is already gone.

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: Morning in Lyrnessus (Briseis POV)
- Opens in media res: Epistrophus arriving while they're eating
- Briseis notes her younger brother—sleeping tunic, hair flattened, that wisp of beard
- Epistrophus mentions a merchant from Miletus, Syrian glass with blue threading
- Mynes: "Glass? We're at war."
- Epistrophus: "The merchant doesn't care. Neither does the glass."
- Briseis: "Pedasus was fine. Thebe was fine."
- The table goes quiet. The argument builds.
- Mynes tries logic: Lyrnessus has walls, they're two days from the coast
- Briseis pushes back: "This is Achilles. He took Thebe in a morning."
- The argument ends unresolved when Epistrophus leaves, promising figs
- Mynes softens, offers to send the horses tomorrow, mentions the healer in Chryse
- He leaves for a delegation. She picks up the pestle, begins to grind.
- The horns sound. Then the screaming.

### Scene 2: The Fall (Briseis POV)
- Briseis runs through the streets. Women with children, old men, overturned cart.
- "The gates!" someone shouts. The gates are open—not broken, open.
- Guards lie in pieces. Greek soldiers pour through.
- At their head, a man with a spear. Smaller than she imagined.
- Briseis runs to the cellar. Hides behind wine jars. Greek boots above.
- The boots come closer.

### Scene 3: The Approach (Achilles POV)
- Brief, efficient: "The walls fell in three hours."
- Achilles wipes his spear on a dead man's cloak, inspects the captives
- The women are huddling, screaming. One stands apart, arms around herself, staring at nothing.
- "That one," he says.
- Patroclus: "She's in shock." Achilles: "I know."

### Scene 4: The March (Briseis POV)
- Greek hands pull her from the cellar
- Marched through the streets. Bodies everywhere.
- Near the eastern wall, a man by a tower—young, thin, a wisp of beard. She looks away.
- Near the main gates, another body. Well-dressed. Merchant's rings.
- She keeps walking.
- Put with other women. Sorted. A Greek with cold eyes points at her.
- Put on a wagon. Watches the city burn as they drive away.

### Scene 5: The Refugees (Hector POV)
- Dusk. Seven refugees arrive at Troy's gates.
- An old man, three women, three children. That's all who escaped.
- "The Myrmidons came at dawn. Achilles led them. The walls held for three hours."
- Hector: "They never do."
- His aide: "Fifth ally city this month." Hector: "I can count."
- In their chambers, Andromache with Astyanax on her lap
- "Astyanax took his first steps today." "His first steps?" "Three of them. He fell on the fourth."
- "I'm sorry I missed it." "You're always sorry."
- She mentions the refugees say Achilles doesn't take ransoms anymore. Just kills.
- "What does that mean?" He doesn't answer.
- He stays at the window. Troy sleeps beneath him.

### Scene 6: The Spoils (Odysseus POV)
- Night. Odysseus oversees the division of spoils.
- Gold weighed, captives counted, grain measured.
- When the others have gone, he stays. Sorts through Trojan coins, jewelry.
- A bag of gold with Trojan markings. A seal ring with Priam's crest.
- He holds the ring up to the lamplight. Turns it.
- Sets it aside with the gold.

### Scene 7: The Tent (Briseis POV)
- A commander's tent. Animal skins, camp bed, maps.
- Achilles sits on the edge of the bed, armor half-removed, staring at nothing.
- Briseis stands near the entrance.
- Nothing happens.
- Patroclus enters, looks at her, then at Achilles. "You should eat something."
- Achilles doesn't respond. "Achilles." "I heard you."
- Patroclus leaves. The camp murmurs outside. Somewhere a woman weeps.
- "There's food," Achilles says. "If you want it."
- Briseis doesn't move.
- She studies him: the man who destroyed her world. Younger than expected. Empty.
- She lowers herself to the ground near the entrance.
- She thinks: Tomorrow he'll do this to another city. And another. I'm going to be here for all of it.
- She closes her eyes.
- When she opens them again, it's dawn, and Achilles is already gone.

## Key Moments
- Epistrophus: "I'll bring you back some figs. The early ones are in."—he won't
- "This is Achilles. He took Thebe in a morning. Your walls won't hold against Achilles."
- The gates are open—not broken, open
- Near the eastern wall, a man by a tower—young, thin, a wisp of beard. She looks away.
- "That one," Achilles says. Patroclus: "She's in shock." Achilles: "I know."
- "Astyanax took his first steps today." "I'm sorry I missed it." "You're always sorry."
- Odysseus setting aside the gold and seal ring (no explanation)
- "When she opened them again, it was dawn, and Achilles was already gone."

## Thematic Threads
- **The ordinary shattered**: Briseis's morning is deliberately mundane—arguments about glass merchants, promises of figs—to make the destruction land harder
- **Flat observation as trauma**: Briseis notes her brother's body, her husband's body, and keeps walking. No tears, no screaming. Just observation.
- **The machine of war**: Achilles is efficient, joyless, mechanical. "The walls fell in three hours." Work, not glory.
- **Parallel imprisonment**: Achilles and Briseis are both captives—she to him, he to the war. Neither speaks. Neither moves.
- **Hector's impossible position**: "I'm sorry I missed it." "You're always sorry."
- **Conspiracy seeding**: Odysseus sets aside gold and a seal ring. The reader doesn't know why. Yet.

## Chapter End
Briseis closes her eyes in Achilles's tent, expecting violence, or nightmares, or something. When she opens them again, it's dawn. The tent is empty. Achilles is already gone—to another raid, another city, another set of walls that won't hold. She's still here. She'll still be here tomorrow. The war continues.
