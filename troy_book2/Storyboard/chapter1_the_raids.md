# Chapter 1: "The Raids"

## POVs
1. Briseis
2. Achilles
3. Briseis (return)
4. Hector
5. Odysseus
6. Briseis (return)

## Summary
The chapter opens in Lyrnessus, a Trojan ally city, on what will be its last morning. Briseis is at breakfast with her husband Mynes when her younger brother Epistrophus arrives. A casual conversation about a Syrian glass merchant turns into an argument about the Greek raids. The argument ends unresolved when Epistrophus leaves for the market, promising figs. Then the horns sound.

The raid is efficient, brutal, joyless. Briseis is pulled from the cellar, sees her brother's body, her husband's body, keeps walking. She is sorted with other women, given to Achilles.

In Troy, Hector receives the refugees. Andromache tells him Astyanax took his first steps today. He missed it.

Brief scene with Odysseus setting aside Trojan gold and a seal ring. No explanation given.

The chapter ends with Briseis's first weeks in Achilles's tent—the progression of nights, the physical relationship from night one, the slow shift toward something more complicated. By the end, she finds herself reaching back when he reaches for her.

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: Morning in Lyrnessus (Briseis POV)
- Opens in media res: Epistrophus arriving while they're eating
- Epistrophus mentions a merchant from Miletus, Syrian glass with blue threading
- Briseis: "Pedasus was fine. Thebe was fine."
- The argument builds. Mynes tries logic. Briseis pushes back.
- Epistrophus leaves, promising figs
- Mynes softens, offers to send the horses tomorrow
- He leaves for a delegation. She picks up the pestle, begins to grind.
- The horns sound. Then the screaming.

### Scene 2: The Fall (Briseis POV)
- Briseis runs through the streets
- The gates are open—not broken, open
- At their head, a man with a spear. Smaller than she imagined.
- Briseis runs to the cellar. Hides behind wine jars.
- The boots come closer.

### Scene 3: The Approach (Achilles POV)
- Brief, efficient: "The walls fell in three hours."
- Achilles wipes his spear, inspects the captives
- One stands apart, staring at nothing.
- "That one," he says.
- Patroclus: "She's in shock." Achilles: "I know."

### Scene 4: The March (Briseis POV)
- Greek hands pull her from the cellar
- Near the eastern wall, a man by a tower—young, thin, a wisp of beard. She looks away.
- Near the main gates, another body. Merchant's rings.
- She keeps walking.
- Put on a wagon. Watches the city burn.

### Scene 5: The Refugees (Hector POV)
- Seven refugees arrive at Troy's gates.
- "The walls held for three hours." Hector: "They never do."
- In their chambers, Andromache with Astyanax
- "Astyanax took his first steps today." "I'm sorry I missed it." "You're always sorry."
- Achilles doesn't take ransoms anymore. Just kills.

### Scene 6: The Spoils (Odysseus POV)
- Night. Odysseus oversees the division of spoils.
- A bag of gold with Trojan markings. A seal ring with Priam's crest.
- He holds the ring up to the lamplight. Sets it aside.

### Scene 7: The Tent (Briseis POV)
- Achilles sits on the bed, staring at nothing.
- Patroclus enters: "You should eat something."
- "There's food," Achilles says to Briseis. "If you want it."
- She lowers herself to the ground near the entrance.
- She thinks: I'm going to be here for all of it.
- She closes her eyes.
- When she opens them, it's dawn. Achilles is already gone.

### Scene 8: The Nights (Briseis POV)
- Later that night, he comes to her.
- His hands calloused, rougher than Mynes's. His weight pressing her into the bed. His eyes fixed on something beyond her.
- When it's over, he rolls away and sleeps. She does not.
- The second night. The third. The fourth. She learns his scars—the puckered wound below his shoulder blade, the thin line across his ribs, the burn on his arm.
- On the fifth night, he speaks: "What's your name?"
- On the seventh night: "Were you married?" "Did you love him?" She doesn't answer.
- The nights continue. She stops counting.
- Then one night, something shifts. He doesn't turn away. "I don't know why I keep doing this. I don't want to. I don't want any of this."
- "Then why do you?"
- "Because if I stop, I'll have to feel something else."
- The next night, when he reaches for her, she finds herself reaching back. Her hand finds the scar on his shoulder blade. He pauses. Looks at her—really looks.
- In the morning, she wakes with his arm across her waist.

## Key Moments
- Epistrophus: "I'll bring you back some figs."—he won't
- The gates are open—not broken, open
- Near the eastern wall, a man by a tower—young, thin, a wisp of beard. She looks away.
- "That one." "She's in shock." "I know."
- "I'm sorry I missed it." "You're always sorry."
- Odysseus setting aside the gold and seal ring
- "I don't know why I keep doing this. I don't want any of this."
- She finds herself reaching back

## Thematic Threads
- **The ordinary shattered**: Briseis's morning is mundane—arguments about glass merchants, promises of figs—to make the destruction land harder
- **Flat observation as trauma**: She notes her brother's body, her husband's body, and keeps walking
- **The machine of war**: Achilles is efficient, joyless, mechanical
- **Conspiracy seeding**: Odysseus sets aside gold and a seal ring. The reader doesn't know why. Yet.
- **Captivity and accommodation**: Briseis's body learns his rhythms before her mind consents. Something grows in the hollow place where her feelings used to be.

## Chapter End
Briseis wakes with Achilles's arm across her waist, his breath warm against her hair. She didn't plan this. She didn't choose it. But her hand found his scar in the dark, and he looked at her—really looked—and neither of them spoke. The war continues outside the tent. Inside, something else is beginning.
