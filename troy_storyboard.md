# THE FALL OF TROY
## A Game of Thrones-Style Storyboard

---

# PART ONE: THE STRUCTURE

## Core Philosophy

**Pacing:** Slow burn with sudden eruptions. Long stretches of political maneuvering, character development, and simmering tension—punctuated by violence that arrives without warning and ends lives mid-sentence.

**Death Style:** No heroic last words. No meaningful final glances. Characters die confused, afraid, or simply *stopped*. The narrative continues without them. Other characters react to deaths pragmatically—grief is real but brief. The war doesn't pause.

**Morality:** No heroes. Everyone believes they're justified. The Greeks are invaders committing atrocities for a stolen woman and wounded pride. The Trojans are defenders harboring a thief who doomed them all. The gods are cruel children playing with ants.

Agamemnon lures Iphigenia to Aulis with a false wedding to Achilles. Achilles discovers his name was used and confronts Agamemnon. Clytemnestra promises vengeance. The sacrifice at dawn—Iphigenia gagged on the altar. The wind rises. Cassandra feels it across the sea. The fleet sails.

---

**Chapter 5: "First Blood"** → [Detailed Storyboard](troy_book1/Storyboard/chapter5_first_blood.md)
*POVs: Hector, Achilles, Paris, Cassandra*

---

## BOOK 2: "THE RAGE"
*Timeline: Years 5-9, focusing on the events leading to the Iliad*
*POVs: Achilles, Hector, Odysseus, Helen, Cassandra, Briseis*

### Thematic Focus
The war's middle years. Despair, adaptation, atrocity. The Greeks raid the countryside. The Trojans bleed slowly. Achilles becomes something less than human. Odysseus becomes something worse.

### Chapter Breakdown

**Chapter 1: "The Raids"**
*POVs: Achilles, Briseis, Hector*

Achilles's routine: attack Trojan allies, strip their resources, take their women. Efficient, brutal, joyless. Patroclus is the only thing keeping him human.

BRISEIS INTRODUCTION: Her city falls. Her brothers die defending the walls. Achilles kills her husband. She's given to him as a prize. Her first POV chapter is pure dissociation—watching herself from outside, a survival mechanism.

Hector receives the refugees. Each fallen ally is another warning. His plan: wait them out. Eventually the Greeks will tire, go home. (He doesn't believe this. But he says it.)

END: Achilles and Briseis alone in his tent. He doesn't touch her. He just sits, staring at nothing. She realizes he's as trapped as she is.

---

**Chapter 2: "The Clever Man"**
*POVs: Odysseus, Cassandra, Paris*

THE PALAMEDES CHAPTER: Odysseus frames Palamedes for treason. Plants Trojan gold in his tent. Forges letters. Palamedes is stoned to death by the army.

Odysseus watches, tells himself it was necessary (Palamedes was too clever, would have exposed other secrets). It's not true. Odysseus just hated him. This is the turn. Everything after is easier.

Cassandra sees it in a vision. Tells her father. Priam doesn't understand why a Greek killing a Greek matters. She can't explain.

Paris in this episode is mostly absent—drinking, bedding servants, avoiding Helen. The romance has curdled. They barely speak.

END: Odysseus washing his hands. The water runs clear. He's fine with what he did.

---

**Chapter 3: "The Other War"**
*POVs: Helen, Briseis, Hector*

THE WOMEN'S WAR: Helen helping with surgery—there's no anesthetic, just men holding down the wounded while she cuts. She's become competent, even valuable.

Briseis in the Greek camp. Watching. Learning. She understands the political factions now. Knows Achilles and Agamemnon hate each other. Knows this knowledge might be useful.

ANDROMACHE SCENE: Hector comes home. Astyanax (their toddler) screams at his bloody armor. Hector removes his helmet, holds his son. Andromache: "Don't go back out." Hector: "I have to." She knew he'd say that.

END: Three women in three locations, all trapped, all adapting.

---

**Chapter 4: "The Insult"**
*POVs: Achilles, Agamemnon, Odysseus*

THE QUARREL: Agamemnon is forced to return Chryseis (Apollo's plague). He takes Briseis from Achilles as compensation. Not because he wants her—because Achilles cannot be allowed to defy him publicly.

Achilles's rage. Not theatrical—cold, absolute. He withdraws to his tent. Tells his men to stand down. Let the Trojans win. Let Agamemnon burn.

Odysseus tries to mediate. Fails. Achilles: "I am not his dog. I am not his weapon. I am Achilles." Odysseus sees a man coming apart.

END: Briseis led to Agamemnon's tent. Achilles watching. His hand on his sword. He lets her go. His revenge will be larger than one death.

---

**Chapter 5: "The Long Night"**
*POVs: Hector, Cassandra, Briseis*

TROJAN ADVANCE: Without Achilles, the Greeks crumble. Hector breaches their defenses, burns their ships. For the first time in years, Troy might win.

Cassandra's dread: "This is the trap. This victory is the trap." No one listens.

Briseis in Agamemnon's tent. He doesn't touch her either—he just needs her present to maintain the insult to Achilles. She's a symbol. She starts talking to him, carefully. Gathering information.

HECTOR'S DILEMMA: Push now and maybe destroy the Greeks entirely. Or pull back and let them negotiate surrender. Priam wants surrender. Hector's men want blood. Paris, useless, suggests nothing.

END: Hector gives the order to press the attack. His last chance to end this. It won't work.

---

**Chapter 6: "The Substitute"**
*POVs: Achilles, Hector, Odysseus*

PATROCLUS: He can't watch anymore. Goes to Achilles. "Let me lead the Myrmidons in your armor. I'll push them back. You keep your pride."

Achilles agrees. Patroclus dons the armor. Drives the Trojans back to the walls. Then pushes too far. Apollo intervenes (shown subtly—a stumble, a loosened strap). Hector kills him. Doesn't know who he's killed until the helmet comes off.

ACHILLES: The moment he hears. Not screaming. Not weeping. Silence. Total silence. Then he starts putting on his armor.

THE BODY: Greeks and Trojans fighting over Patroclus's corpse. Achilles arrives. The battlefield empties. No one will face him. Hector retreats.

END: Achilles carrying Patroclus's body. Walking through a field of men he killed to retrieve it. His face is wrong. Something inside him has finally broken.

---

## BOOK 3: "THE DEATH OF HECTOR"
*Timeline: The final weeks of Year 10*
*POVs: Achilles, Hector, Odysseus, Helen, Priam*

### Thematic Focus
The death spiral. Achilles becomes a demon. Hector becomes a sacrifice. The war is no longer about Helen or honor—it's about killing and dying.

### Chapter Breakdown

**Chapter 1: "The Funeral"**
*POVs: Achilles, Hector, Cassandra*

Achilles refusing to bury Patroclus. Killing prisoners instead, stacking bodies for the pyre. He's looking for meaning in death. Finding none.

Hector at home. Andromache knows what's coming. She doesn't beg him to run—she knows he won't. She just asks to spend the night holding him.

THE ARMOR: Hephaestus (at Thetis's request) forges new armor for Achilles. The shield shows the cosmos—life, death, peace, war. All of it. Achilles barely looks at it.

END: Dawn. Achilles walks toward the walls. Hector watches him come.

---

**Chapter 2: "The River"**
*POVs: Achilles, Helen, Odysseus*

Achilles's rampage. Not single combat—slaughter. He kills so many Trojans that the river Scamander chokes on corpses and rises against him. He fights the river. He fights a god. He wins.

Helen watching from the walls. The Trojan women weeping. This is what they brought upon themselves. This is what was brought upon them.

Odysseus in the Greek camp, planning. He sees Achilles and feels something new: pity. The man is already dead. He's just forgotten to fall down.

END: Achilles at the gates, calling for Hector. His voice is not human.

---

**Chapter 3: "The Duel"**
*POVs: Hector, Achilles, Priam*

HECTOR'S LAST MORNING: He puts on his armor. Kisses his son. Andromache won't look at him. He understands. At the gates, his father begs him to stay inside. He can't.

THE CHASE: Hector runs. Three times around the walls. Not cowardice—survival instinct. He knows he'll die. His body doesn't. Athena disguised as his brother stops him, tells him they'll fight together. He turns to face Achilles. The god vanishes.

THE FIGHT: Quick, brutal, one-sided. Hector's spear breaks on Achilles's shield. Achilles's spear finds Hector's throat. Hector falls.

HIS LAST WORDS: "Return my body to my father. Let me burn." Achilles: "No."

END: Achilles tying Hector's corpse to his chariot. Dragging it around Troy's walls. Andromache's scream. Priam's silence.

---

**Chapter 4: "The Father"**
*POVs: Priam, Achilles, Cassandra*

THE RANSOM: Priam goes alone to the Greek camp. Past the guards (divine help). Into Achilles's tent. The king kneels before his son's killer.

"I do what no father has ever done. I kiss the hands that killed my children."

Achilles looks at this old man. Sees his own father, who will never see him again. 

They weep together. They share a meal. For one night, they are not enemies. Just two men caught in something neither can escape.

Achilles returns the body. Grants twelve days' truce for the funeral.

Cassandra's POV: watching her father leave, watching him return. Knowing this changes nothing. The doom remains.

END: Hector's funeral pyre. Troy mourns. Achilles in his tent, alone, staring at his own armor. Waiting for his turn.

---

**Chapter 5: "The Arrow"**
*POVs: Achilles, Odysseus, Paris*

ACHILLES'S FINAL DAYS: He's calm now. Finished. He's killed Hector. He's mourned Patroclus. He's done what he came to do.

PARIS'S CHAPTER: The despised brother, the cause of everything, finally relevant. Apollo comes to him. Shows him where to aim. Paris doesn't ask questions.

THE DEATH: Achilles at the temple of Apollo (negotiating? praying? we're not sure). An arrow from nowhere. Finds his heel, his one vulnerability.

He doesn't die immediately. He falls. Looks at the arrow, confused. Tries to stand. Falls again. Crawls toward the exit. Doesn't make it.

No final words. No glorious last stand. The greatest warrior of his age dies on a temple floor, alone, shot by the weakest prince in the story.

Odysseus finds his body. Closes his eyes. The war will continue.

END: Paris looking at his bow. Understanding nothing. Feeling only relief.

---

**Chapter 6: "The Horse"**
*POVs: Odysseus, Cassandra, Helen*

THE PLAN: Odysseus conceives the horse. We see him build it—not just physically, but politically. Convincing the kings. Selecting the men. Preparing the fleet to fake their withdrawal.

Cassandra sees it coming. Screams her warnings. "There are men in the horse! Burn it! Burn it!" Priam shakes his head sadly. His mad daughter.

Helen in the crowd. She knows. She circles the horse at night, imitating the voices of the Greek wives. Testing. Inside, the men hold their breath. Odysseus covers one man's mouth so hard he leaves bruises.

THE GIFT is brought inside the walls. Troy celebrates. After ten years, victory.

END: Night. Silence. Helen standing at her window, watching the horse in the plaza below. Waiting.

---

## BOOK 4: "THE FALL"
*Timeline: The Sack of Troy and its aftermath*
*POVs: Odysseus, Helen, Cassandra, Andromache*

### Thematic Focus
The bill comes due. Every death, every atrocity the war enabled. Victory is indistinguishable from damnation. No one survives this clean.

### Chapter Breakdown

**Chapter 1: "The Night"**
*POVs: Odysseus, Helen, Cassandra*

THE BELLY OF THE HORSE: The men inside, breathing in darkness. Odysseus counting heartbeats. The signal fire on the headland.

They emerge. Open the gates. The Greek army pours in.

What follows is not a battle. It's a massacre.

Helen locks herself in her room. Listens to the screaming. Waits.

Cassandra in the temple of Athena. She knows Locrian Ajax is coming for her. She knows what he'll do. She lights a candle and waits.

END: Troy burning. No music. Just screams, and fire, and silence.

---

**Chapter 2: "The Sack"**
*POVs: Andromache, Odysseus, Cassandra*

ANDROMACHE'S CHAPTER: The soldiers come for Astyanax. Odysseus's order—Hector's son cannot live to seek revenge.

They throw the child from the walls.

Andromache doesn't scream. She's past screaming. She watches the men who did it, memorizing their faces.

CASSANDRA: Dragged from the temple. The rape happens off-screen, but we see Ajax emerge, wiping his hands. Cassandra follows, bloodied, silent. Agamemnon claims her as his prize.

ODYSSEUS: Walking through the burning city. Seeing the old men cut down, the children separated from mothers, the temples looted. He tells himself this is how wars end. He doesn't believe it.

END: Dawn over Troy. The fires dying down. The screaming stopped. Only weeping now.

---

**Chapter 3: "The Reckoning"**
*POVs: Helen, Andromache, Odysseus*

HELEN AND MENELAUS: He finds her. Sword raised. She doesn't beg. She just looks at him. The most beautiful woman in the world. He can't do it. He never could.

He takes her hand. Leads her to the ships. The Greek soldiers mutter. They burned a city for her. She walks out untouched.

ANDROMACHE: Enslaved to Neoptolemus (Achilles's son). A brutal boy who killed Priam at the altar. She will outlive him. She will see him die. She stores this knowledge like a weapon.

ODYSSEUS: The division of spoils. Women as property. Gold by the talents. Hecuba going to Odysseus himself. The old queen who once ruled this city, now his slave. She'll curse him until she dies.

END: The ships loading. Troy a smoking ruin. Cassandra's voice: "The wind will turn against you all. The gods are not finished."

---

**Chapter 4: "The Returns"**
*POVs: Odysseus, Cassandra, Andromache*

THE FLEET SCATTERS: Storms. The gods' punishment for the temple rape, for the atrocities, for the hubris. Ships lost. Men drowned.

AGAMEMNON'S RETURN: He arrives home to Mycenae. Clytemnestra is waiting. She's had ten years to prepare.

Cassandra at the gates of Mycenae. Her last POV chapter. She knows what's inside. Death for Agamemnon. Death for herself. She walks in anyway. "Why escape?" she asks no one. "I've seen how this ends since I was a girl."

THE MURDER: Not shown directly. Red cloth on water. Screaming. Then silence.

END: Cassandra's body beside Agamemnon's. Her eyes open, fixed on the ceiling. For the first time in her life, she looks peaceful.

---

**Chapter 5: "The Long Way Home"**
*POVs: Odysseus, Helen, Andromache*

ODYSSEUS'S JOURNEY BEGINS: The cyclops (just the beginning). He'll wander ten more years. The man who burned Troy can't find his way home.

HELEN IN EGYPT: A variant tradition—she was never at Troy. A phantom took her place. She's been in Egypt the whole time.

This is never confirmed or denied. Helen speaks to an Egyptian priest about the war. "I don't know if I caused it," she says. "I don't know if I was there. I know ten thousand men are dead, and I'm still standing here, beautiful and useless."

ANDROMACHE: In Epirus with Neoptolemus. Planning. Waiting. She will have three more husbands, three kingdoms, children who will conquer. Hector's wife will outlive everyone who destroyed her.

END: The three survivors, scattered across the Mediterranean. The war is over. The suffering continues.

---

**Chapter 6: "Ashes"** (FINALE)
*POVs: Odysseus, Helen, Andromache*

YEARS LATER:

Odysseus finally home. Penelope doesn't recognize him at first. Neither does he recognize himself. He kills the suitors. Reclaims his kingdom. Holds his wife. And wakes every night screaming.

Helen in Sparta. Old now, still beautiful. Menelaus is dead. She rules alone. Telemachus (Odysseus's son) visits, seeking news of his father. She tells him stories. Doesn't mention that she was the reason his father left.

Andromache, an old woman, telling her grandchildren about Troy. She makes Hector a hero. She makes Achilles a monster. She doesn't mention that she watched them throw her son from the walls. Some stories are not for children.

FINAL SCENE: The plains of Troy. Grass grows over the ruins. A shepherd boy finds a broken sword, rusted beyond use. He throws it away.

The wind blows. The grass sways. Troy is gone.

END.

# PART FOUR: CHARACTER DEATH SCHEDULE

## Major Deaths by Episode

| Character | Death Episode | Cause | POV Witness |
|-----------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| Iphigenia | B1C4 | Sacrifice | Agamemnon |
| Palamedes | B2C2 | Execution (stoning) | Odysseus |
| Patroclus | B2C6 | Killed by Hector | Achilles |
| Hector | B3C3 | Killed by Achilles | Priam |

## Death Style Notes

**Hector:** The only "noble" death, and it's still pathetic—he runs first. His courage is just exhaustion.

**Achilles:** Deliberately anticlimactic. No worthy opponent. Just an arrow and a long crawl to nowhere.

**Patroclus:** The death that breaks Achilles. Shown in full, brutal detail.

**Astyanax:** Not shown directly. We see Andromache's face. We hear the sound. That's worse.

**Cassandra:** Dies knowing exactly what would happen. Her death is almost a relief.

---

# PART FIVE: KEY THEMES & MOTIFS

## Running Themes

**"Was it worth it?"** — Asked directly or implied in every book. Never answered.

**The gods as weather** — Divine intervention exists but is treated like natural disaster. Impersonal. Unstoppable. Unfair.

**Women as currency** — Helen, Briseis, Cassandra, Andromache. The war is fought over women, by men, and the women pay the price.

**The lie of glory** — Achilles seeks it, achieves it, finds it hollow. Hector never wanted it and dies anyway.

**Fathers and sons** — Priam/Hector, Achilles/Peleus, Odysseus/Telemachus. Men who will never see each other again. Children who will be killed to prevent revenge.

## Visual Motifs

**Walls** — Troy's walls, the Greek camp's walls, the walls women build around themselves.

**Fire** — Funeral pyres, burning ships, Troy ablaze. Fire consumes everything.

**The sea** — The Greeks came from it and will die trying to cross it again.

**Empty armor** — Patroclus in Achilles's armor. Achilles in divine armor he never earned. Hector stripped naked in death.
