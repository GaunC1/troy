# HELEN — "The Cause"

**POV Status:** Primary (Every season)

**Starting State:** The most beautiful woman in the world—which means the most owned woman in the world. Stolen by Theseus at 12. Married to Menelaus for politics. Taken by Paris for... love? Lust? Divine compulsion? Even she's not sure.

**Arc:** Object of desire → Prisoner of guilt → Agent of her own fate → Survivor

**Core Tension:** Did she choose Paris or was she taken? She doesn't know. The distinction mattered once. Now she's trapped in a city that hates her, waiting to be "rescued" by a husband who'll probably kill her. She starts making her own moves.

## Motivation Evolution

- S1: Understand what happened to her, whether she chose this
- S2: Survive the hatred of Troy's women, find some purpose
- S3: Protect Trojan women from what's coming (she knows what Greek soldiers do)
- S4: Survive the sack, escape both sides

## Key Relationships

- **Paris** — is it love? Stockholm syndrome? Divine manipulation? Yes.
- **Menelaus** — the husband who was kind enough, whose kindness means nothing now
- **Hecuba** — the queen who should hate her but sees the trap they're both in
- **Cassandra** — the mad princess who sees Helen for what she really is

## Book One Events

**Chapter 1:** At a feast in Sparta, Helen experiences an inexplicable connection when her eyes meet Paris's across the table. She spills wine, goes pale, and her hands tremble - the first crack in her carefully controlled existence. She feels something she hasn't felt in years: alive.

**Chapter 2:** Helen reveals her trauma to Paris in a moonlit garden - abducted at twelve by Theseus, married off to Menelaus for politics, feeling nothing for years. When Menelaus leaves for a hunting trip, Paris asks her to come to Troy. She visits her sleeping daughter Hermione, acknowledging she hasn't been a good mother, then makes her choice: she walks onto the ship herself, watching Sparta vanish. Upon arriving in Troy, she locks eyes with Cassandra in a tower window and feels an unspoken recognition - "She knows. Everything. How this ends."

**Chapter 3:** Helen approaches Cassandra after being dismissed from the throne room, telling her "I believe you" about her visions - the first person to do so. Cassandra shares a disturbing vision of a Greek girl in white who will be sacrificed before the ships sail.

**Chapter 5:** Five years into the war. Helen tends Paris after the failed duel with Menelaus, where divine intervention (or someone's horn) saved his life. She witnesses Hector's cold condemnation of Paris and later finds Paris confessing he froze because he couldn't kill "someone's son, someone's brother."

**Chapter 6:** Helen has found purpose working in Troy's healing house, changing bandages and tending the wounded. A soldier whose brother died blames her; she accepts it without flinching. A noblewoman grudgingly acknowledges Helen's usefulness. Helen visits Cassandra regularly, bringing food, sitting with her through the visions. When a raided village's dead are brought through the gates - including a child Hector carries himself - Helen accepts blame from an angry woman: "I know." That night, she tells Paris that love doesn't help with the guilt, "but it's something. It's the only thing I have."

**Character Development:** Helen transforms from a passive, numb possession ("feeling nothing for years") into someone who takes agency - first by choosing to board the ship, then by choosing to be useful despite universal hatred. Her friendship with Cassandra, built on their shared experience of being cursed and trapped, becomes her one authentic connection in Troy.

## Book 1 Speech Samples

### Voice Mechanics

**Sentence structure:** Simple, declarative, stripped of ornamentation. She doesn't defend or explain—she states. Her sentences are short when accepting blame, longer when describing her interior life.

**Tense:** Past tense for trauma ("I've been performing for so long"), present tense for what she's chosen to do now. The shift marks her transformation from object to agent.

**Rhythm:** Controlled, almost clinical when discussing herself. She describes her own numbness the way a physician describes symptoms—detached, precise.

**What she talks about:** What she feels (or doesn't), what she's done, what she can't change. She narrates her own guilt without self-pity.

**What she avoids:** Excuses. She never says "but" after accepting blame. No appeals for understanding. She states the accusation, agrees with it, and moves on.

**Emotion marker:** Stillness. She has learned not to flinch. The more terrible the accusation, the quieter her response. Her defiance is in continuing to exist, not in arguing.

**Verbal tics:** "I know" (accepting blame), "It's something" (finding meaning in small actions), trailing sentences that refuse to complete themselves.

**Contrast:** Where Cassandra is exhausted by truth, Helen is exhausted by performance. Where Paris deflects, Helen absorbs.
