# HELEN — "The Cause"

**POV Status:** Primary (Every season)

**Starting State:** The most beautiful woman in the world—which means the most owned woman in the world. Stolen by Theseus at 12. Married to Menelaus for politics. Taken by Paris for... love? Lust? Divine compulsion? Even she's not sure.

**Arc:** Object of desire → Prisoner of guilt → Agent of her own fate → Survivor

**Core Tension:** Did she choose Paris or was she taken? She doesn't know. The distinction mattered once. Now she's trapped in a city that hates her, waiting to be "rescued" by a husband who'll probably kill her. She starts making her own moves.

## Motivation Evolution

- S1: Understand what happened to her, whether she chose this
- S2: Survive the hatred of Troy's women, find some purpose
- S3: Protect Trojan women from what's coming (she knows what Greek soldiers do)
- S4: Survive the sack, escape both sides

## Key Relationships

- **Paris** — is it love? Stockholm syndrome? Divine manipulation? Yes.
- **Menelaus** — the husband who was kind enough, whose kindness means nothing now
- **Hecuba** — the queen who should hate her but sees the trap they're both in
- **Cassandra** — the mad princess who sees Helen for what she really is

## Book One Events

**Chapter 1:** At a feast in Sparta, Helen experiences an inexplicable connection when her eyes meet Paris's across the table. She spills wine, goes pale, and her hands tremble - the first crack in her carefully controlled existence. She feels something she hasn't felt in years: alive.

**Chapter 2:** Helen reveals her trauma to Paris in a moonlit garden - abducted at twelve by Theseus, married off to Menelaus for politics, feeling nothing for years. When Menelaus leaves for a hunting trip, Paris asks her to come to Troy. She visits her sleeping daughter Hermione, acknowledging she hasn't been a good mother, then makes her choice: she walks onto the ship herself, watching Sparta vanish. Upon arriving in Troy, she locks eyes with Cassandra in a tower window and feels an unspoken recognition - "She knows. Everything. How this ends."

**Chapter 3:** Helen approaches Cassandra after being dismissed from the throne room, telling her "I believe you" about her visions - the first person to do so. Cassandra shares a disturbing vision of a Greek girl in white who will be sacrificed before the ships sail.

**Chapter 5:** Five years into the war. Helen tends Paris after the failed duel with Menelaus, where divine intervention (or someone's horn) saved his life. She witnesses Hector's cold condemnation of Paris and later finds Paris confessing he froze because he couldn't kill "someone's son, someone's brother."

**Chapter 6:** Helen has found purpose working in Troy's healing house, changing bandages and tending the wounded. A soldier whose brother died blames her; she accepts it without flinching. A noblewoman grudgingly acknowledges Helen's usefulness. Helen visits Cassandra regularly, bringing food, sitting with her through the visions. When a raided village's dead are brought through the gates - including a child Hector carries himself - Helen accepts blame from an angry woman: "I know." That night, she tells Paris that love doesn't help with the guilt, "but it's something. It's the only thing I have."

**Character Development:** Helen transforms from a passive, numb possession ("feeling nothing for years") into someone who takes agency - first by choosing to board the ship, then by choosing to be useful despite universal hatred. Her friendship with Cassandra, built on their shared experience of being cursed and trapped, becomes her one authentic connection in Troy.

## Book 1 Audit

### Vocal Style: STRONG

Helen's voice is remarkably consistent across all her appearances. Key characteristics that hold throughout:

**1. Sparse, direct dialogue:** Helen speaks in short, declarative sentences that reflect her emotional guardedness. Examples:
- Ch1: "The heat. Just the heat." (deflecting)
- Ch2: "I know exactly what you're asking." / "Nothing. Just the sun." (to Paris)
- Ch3: "I believe you. I don't know if that helps. But I do." (to Cassandra)
- Ch6: "I know." / "I try." / "I know." (accepting blame without defense)

This pattern of terse, undefended responses is one of her most distinctive traits and remains rock-solid throughout.

**2. Self-aware guilt without self-pity:** When confronted about the war's cost, Helen never makes excuses or deflects blame:
- Ch6: "I know." (to soldier blaming her for his brother's death)
- Ch6: "This is because of us. All of it. The village. The dead. That little girl."
- Ch6: "I don't know. I just do." (when asked how she lives with it)

**3. Emotional numbness as default state:** The profile establishes she's "felt nothing for years," and this carries through:
- Ch2: "I feel nothing. I've felt nothing for years."
- Ch6: "No. It doesn't help. Nothing helps."

The voice is well-calibrated for a graded reader - her syntax is simple but emotionally resonant.

### Continuity: NO ERRORS FOUND

Helen's knowledge and timeline track correctly:

- **Ch1:** She knows nothing about Paris except what she sees at the feast. Her physical reaction (spilling wine, going pale) is involuntary, not informed.
- **Ch2:** She reveals her backstory to Paris gradually, and her decision to leave is shown as a process (garden conversation, then the harbor). She sees Cassandra in the tower upon arrival - a glimpse, not a conversation.
- **Ch3:** Her approach to Cassandra ("I believe you") makes sense as a follow-up to the tower moment. She has no knowledge of Iphigenia's fate before Cassandra shares the vision.
- **Ch5 & Ch6:** The five-year time jump is handled well. Helen references her healing house work as established practice, and her relationship with Cassandra is shown as ongoing ("This was their ritual now, almost every evening").

One potential question: In Ch3, Helen seems to find Cassandra quickly after being "dismissed from the throne room." The profile notes this but the chapter itself only shows her trailing Cassandra into the corridor after the council scene. This works - she's following, not being sent.

### Arc Strengthening: OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED

**WORKING WELL:**
- The arc from "object" to "agent" is clear. Ch2 shows her choosing to board the ship ("this time, for the first time, she had walked onto the ship herself"). Ch6 shows her choosing to be useful at the healing house.
- Her friendship with Cassandra is beautifully developed as a parallel between two cursed/trapped women.
- The final scene of Ch6 - Helen bringing Cassandra breakfast, sitting with her through the visions - is a perfect embodiment of her evolved state: quiet service, presence without expectation of redemption.

**OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT:**

**1. The Hermione scene (Ch2) could resonate forward:**
Helen's goodbye to her sleeping daughter is powerful: "She had not been a good mother. She knew this." But Hermione never comes up again in Book 1. A brief reference in Ch5 or Ch6 - even a single line about wondering what her daughter thinks of her now - would deepen the cost Helen carries. The profile mentions her arc includes protecting "Trojan women from what's coming" in S3, which could be seeded here by connecting her guilt about abandoning Hermione to her care for others.

**2. Her physical agency could be more visible in Ch5-6:**
In Ch1-3, Helen's body tells her story: trembling hands, spilled wine, walking onto the ship. In Ch5-6, she's mostly passive physically - sitting, standing, accepting. Consider: Does she flinch when soldiers curse at her? Does she touch the wounded with particular care? Small physical details would reinforce her transformation without adding dialogue.

**3. The Cassandra friendship deserves one moment of reciprocity:**
Currently, Helen gives to Cassandra (food, presence, belief) but we don't see what Cassandra gives Helen. Even one line where Cassandra says something that helps Helen understand her own situation would make the relationship feel more mutual. In Ch3, Cassandra shares the vision of Iphigenia, but this is warning, not comfort. Perhaps in Ch6, Cassandra could say something that acknowledges Helen's genuine change - "You're different now. Less gold, more..." - before trailing off into vision. This would mark Helen's growth through another character's eyes.

**4. The "Did she choose Paris or was she taken?" question:**
The profile identifies this as Helen's core tension, but by Ch6 this question seems resolved in favor of "she chose." This is appropriate for Book 1, but consider: Does Helen ever wonder if Aphrodite's influence is still operating? A moment of doubt about whether her love for Paris is real or divine manipulation would add complexity and set up future conflict.

### Minor Notes

- **Ch5:** Helen appears briefly, tending Paris after the failed duel. The line "That's not weakness" (defending his inability to kill) is slightly more assertive than her usual voice. However, this could be read as her being protective of Paris specifically, which is consistent.

- **Ch6:** The morning intimacy scene is well-handled. Paris initiates; Helen responds but doesn't surrender her plans for the day. This balances their genuine connection with her need for purpose beyond him.

- **Ch6:** "But it's something. It's the only thing I have." This line is excellent - it captures both her love for Paris and her awareness that love doesn't absolve guilt. Consider whether this line could be seeded earlier (perhaps in Ch5 after the duel) so it reads as a developing philosophy rather than arriving fully formed.

### Summary

Helen is one of the strongest characters in Book 1. Her voice is consistent, her arc is clear, and her scenes with Cassandra are highlights. The main opportunities are: (1) more forward references to Hermione, (2) more physical action/reaction in later chapters, and (3) one moment where Cassandra gives something back to Helen, marking her transformation through external eyes.
