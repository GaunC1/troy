# PRIAM — "The Father"

**POV Status:** Secondary (Season 3)

Added late to show the Trojan perspective as the end approaches. An old man watching his children die. His chapter retrieving Hector's body from Achilles is the emotional climax of Season 3.

## Book One Events

Priam appears briefly in Book One, primarily as a background authority figure rather than an active participant in events.

**Chapter 1: The Apple**
- Referenced by Athena when she identifies Paris as "Son of Priam, prince of Troy" during the judgment of the goddesses
- Mentioned in the backstory as the king who ordered infant Paris exposed on Mount Ida to die because of Hecuba's dream that Paris would destroy Troy
- Appears in the courtyard welcoming Paris home, embracing him while Hecuba weeps (observed by Cassandra from her tower window)

**Chapter 2: The Theft**
- Referenced by Paris when explaining his origins to Helen in the garden ("My father—King Priam—he ordered me killed")
- Mentioned by Hector as "composing a response" when news arrives that Paris has stolen Helen and the Spartan treasury

**Chapter 3: The Oath**
- Presides over a throne room scene where Cassandra confronts the royal family about the coming Greek invasion
- Described as sitting on his throne looking "old and tired"
- Attempts to reassure Cassandra, saying Troy has weathered threats before and can negotiate or pay reparations
- Dismisses Cassandra's warnings, telling her he cannot make decisions based on her visions

**Chapter 5: First Blood**
- Presides over the council debating Menelaus's challenge to single combat
- Silences the arguing nobles and asks Hector for his recommendation
- Questions Paris directly: "You understand what you're agreeing to?" and "Can you beat him?"
- Authorizes the duel after Paris accepts the challenge despite admitting he will probably lose

**Summary:** In Book One, Priam functions as the aging patriarch whose past decisions (ordering Paris's death, then accepting him back) set the tragedy in motion. He appears only in brief throne room scenes, portrayed as an old king who cannot fully grasp the scale of destruction approaching Troy. His interactions are limited to presiding over family councils and deferring to Hector on military matters.

## Book 1 Speech Samples

### Voice Mechanics

**Sentence structure:** Formal, measured sentences in council—the rhythm of a king accustomed to being obeyed. But when facing Paris, his sentences fragment, grow uncertain, trail into questions.

**Tense:** Past tense dominates when speaking of his guilt; conditional tense ("Maybe this is how it ends") when trying to find meaning in tragedy.

**Rhythm:** Slow, heavy with age. He speaks like a man carrying weight. Long pauses between thoughts. His authority comes from stillness, not force.

**What he talks about:** Troy's past glories, its defenses, the formalities of negotiation—in public. In private, the choice he made on a mountainside decades ago, and whether any of this is his fault.

**What he avoids:** Admitting Troy is truly in danger. He speaks of negotiation and reparations when the reader knows these are fantasies. His denial is quieter than Paris's but just as complete.

**Emotion marker:** His hands. They tremble. His voice may stay steady, but his body betrays him. Guilt surfaces as physical fragility.

**Verbal tics:** "We'll negotiate..." (denial), "I don't know if I'm proud of you or ashamed of myself" (tangled paternal feeling), "Maybe the seers were wrong" (grasping for hope).

**Contrast:** Where Hector sees doom clearly, Priam cannot bear to. Where Cassandra states prophecy, Priam searches for exceptions to it.

- "I exposed you on a mountain. When you were born. The seers said you would destroy us, and I chose my city over my son. And now here you are. Offering to die for us. After everything I did." — `troy_book1/troy_book1_chapter5_v3.md:572`
- "I don't know if I'm proud of you or ashamed of myself. Both, maybe. Both at once." — `troy_book1/troy_book1_chapter5_v3.md:576`
- "The prophecy isn't finished yet. Maybe this is how it ends. Maybe you die tomorrow, and the war ends, and Troy survives. Maybe the seers were wrong, or maybe they were right in a way we didn't understand." — `troy_book1/troy_book1_chapter5_v3.md:582`

## Book 2 Arc

**Chapter 2: The Clever Man**

Priam appears in a single brief scene, in the war room with his generals. The setting establishes his focus: maps on the table, little wooden markers representing ships, walls, men. He is managing a conventional siege, thinking in terms of tactics and territory.

Cassandra enters with a cryptic vision: "The snake swallows its tail. Across the water. They eat their own. One of them is hungry. One of them has been hungry for years." This refers to Odysseus murdering Palamedes—Greeks killing Greeks—but Priam cannot parse the riddle. He asks "Who? The Greeks?" When Cassandra admits she can't see the face, only the hands, Priam dismisses her: "Get some rest."

This is the defining Priam gesture: not cruelty, but exhaustion. He cannot afford to engage with prophecy that offers no actionable intelligence. The war room demands concrete answers—troop positions, supply lines, weather patterns. Cassandra speaks in symbols; Priam needs numbers.

**Thematic significance:** While Greeks are tearing themselves apart with treachery (the Palamedes frame-up), Priam remains unaware, focused on the wrong battlefield. His seal has been stolen and used by Odysseus to forge evidence. Priam is being weaponized without his knowledge—his royal authority turned into a tool of Greek infighting.

**What Priam misses:** The storyboard notes that Priam "doesn't understand why a Greek killing a Greek matters." But it does matter—Palamedes was clever, skeptical, the kind of man who might have seen through Odysseus's schemes. His death makes the Greek army more unified under Odysseus's hidden influence, and brings the Trojan Horse one step closer.

## Character Goals / Conspiracies / Missions

### What Priam Wants

**Primary goal: Troy's survival.** Not victory—survival. He knows the Greeks outnumber them. He knows the siege could last years. His hope is endurance: outlast the enemy, make the war too costly, wait for the Greeks to fracture and sail home.

**Secondary goal: Paris's redemption.** The guilt of the mountainside haunts him. He ordered his son killed, the son returned, and now that son may destroy everything. If Paris could somehow prove himself—in battle, in diplomacy, in sacrifice—it might mean the prophecy was wrong. Or that Priam was wrong to believe it.

**Hidden goal: To die before the fall.** He never says this. But an old king who has outlived too many sons, who watches his city besieged, who dismissed every warning—such a man might hope the end comes for him before he has to witness the worst. (This wish will be denied. He will see Hector dragged. He will kiss Achilles's hands. He will die at the altar in Book 4.)

### What He Is Working Toward

**Diplomatic channels:** Even during siege, messengers move between armies. Priam likely maintains back-channel communications with Greek moderates—men who might accept reparations and Helen's return. Nestor, perhaps. Or Diomedes, whose father sacked Thebes and knows what victory costs.

**Alliance maintenance:** Troy's strength comes from allies—Lycians, Dardanians, Mysians, Thracians. These are not Trojans; they fight for payment, or for treaties, or for old debts. Priam must keep them committed. When allies start calculating whether Troy can actually win, the siege ends.

**The succession question:** Hector is the obvious heir, but Hector may die. Paris is next in line but useless. Deiphobus is capable but cold. Priam must think about what happens after him—and what happens if Hector falls first.

### Current Status (Book 2)

Priam is **reactive rather than active.** He presides over war councils but lets Hector make tactical decisions. He dismisses Cassandra's warnings. He appears briefly, speaks little, then fades into the background.

This is a problem for the narrative: Priam risks becoming a passive symbol rather than a character.

## Agency Analysis

### The Problem

In Books 1-2, Priam functions as:
- A throne-room presence who defers to Hector
- A guilt-ridden father who broods over Paris
- A dismissive audience for Cassandra's warnings

He makes no active choices that drive the plot. Things happen around him; he reacts. The war room scene in Book 2 Chapter 2 crystallizes this: he is surrounded by maps and markers, but we never see him move the pieces.

### Suggestions for Giving Priam Active Purpose

**1. The Diplomatic Gambit**
Priam could be secretly negotiating with a Greek faction—perhaps Ajax's Salaminian contingent, who resent Agamemnon's leadership. He could offer gold, or safe passage, or marriage alliances. This gives him a scheme that runs parallel to the main war, something he controls while Hector fights battles.

*Complication:* These negotiations could be discovered by Hector, who would see them as undermining his military strategy. Father and son at cross-purposes—Hector fighting to win, Priam maneuvering to survive.

**2. The Cassandra Dilemma**
Rather than simply dismissing Cassandra, Priam could struggle with her. He could have a private advisor—a priest, a trusted counselor—who believes the prophecies and pushes Priam to act on them. Priam refuses, but the tension remains. Later, when Cassandra's warnings prove true, his guilt compounds.

*Complication:* What if Priam did act on a prophecy once, and it went wrong? What if his decision to expose Paris was based on a seer's advice, and now he no longer trusts any prophecy?

**3. The Paris Problem**
Priam could actively intervene in Paris's decline—forcing him into military training, arranging a public role for him, even threatening disinheritance. This creates friction: Paris resisting, Helen caught between them, Hector watching his brother be humiliated.

*Complication:* Every attempt to fix Paris makes things worse. The harder Priam pushes, the more Paris retreats into wine and servant girls.

**4. The Alliance Crisis**
A key ally—perhaps the Lycians under Sarpedon, or the Thracians under Rhesus—could demand more payment, or threaten withdrawal. Priam must negotiate, compromise, perhaps sacrifice something valuable to keep the coalition together. This shows him as a political actor, not just a grieving father.

*Complication:* The price is too high. Priam pays it anyway. The audience sees what desperation costs.

**5. The Succession Conspiracy**
Someone at court—Deiphobus, or a faction of nobles—could be positioning for power after Priam. The old king isn't blind; he sees the maneuvering. He could quietly counter-maneuver, protecting Hector's position, marginalizing rivals.

*Complication:* Priam's political skills are rusty. He makes mistakes. The court fractures further.

### The Core Tension

Priam's tragedy is that he made the defining choice of his life fifty years ago, on a mountainside, and has been living in its shadow ever since. Every decision since then has been reaction, not action. He took Paris back because he felt guilty. He let Paris keep Helen because he couldn't condemn his son again. He dismisses Cassandra because believing her would mean admitting his original sin was not enough—that the curse continues despite his sacrifice.

**To give Priam agency is to show him trying to escape this pattern**—and failing. He schemes, he negotiates, he fights his own paralysis. But the wheel turns. The snake swallows its tail. Some fathers doom their children by action; some by inaction. Priam has done both.
