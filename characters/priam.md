# PRIAM — "The Father"

**POV Status:** Secondary (Season 3)

Added late to show the Trojan perspective as the end approaches. An old man watching his children die. His chapter retrieving Hector's body from Achilles is the emotional climax of Season 3.

## Book One Events

Priam appears briefly in Book One, primarily as a background authority figure rather than an active participant in events.

**Chapter 1: The Apple**
- Referenced by Athena when she identifies Paris as "Son of Priam, prince of Troy" during the judgment of the goddesses
- Mentioned in the backstory as the king who ordered infant Paris exposed on Mount Ida to die because of Hecuba's dream that Paris would destroy Troy
- Appears in the courtyard welcoming Paris home, embracing him while Hecuba weeps (observed by Cassandra from her tower window)

**Chapter 2: The Theft**
- Referenced by Paris when explaining his origins to Helen in the garden ("My father—King Priam—he ordered me killed")
- Mentioned by Hector as "composing a response" when news arrives that Paris has stolen Helen and the Spartan treasury

**Chapter 3: The Oath**
- Presides over a throne room scene where Cassandra confronts the royal family about the coming Greek invasion
- Described as sitting on his throne looking "old and tired"
- Attempts to reassure Cassandra, saying Troy has weathered threats before and can negotiate or pay reparations
- Dismisses Cassandra's warnings, telling her he cannot make decisions based on her visions

**Chapter 5: First Blood**
- Presides over the council debating Menelaus's challenge to single combat
- Silences the arguing nobles and asks Hector for his recommendation
- Questions Paris directly: "You understand what you're agreeing to?" and "Can you beat him?"
- Authorizes the duel after Paris accepts the challenge despite admitting he will probably lose

**Summary:** In Book One, Priam functions as the aging patriarch whose past decisions (ordering Paris's death, then accepting him back) set the tragedy in motion. He appears only in brief throne room scenes, portrayed as an old king who cannot fully grasp the scale of destruction approaching Troy. His interactions are limited to presiding over family councils and deferring to Hector on military matters.
