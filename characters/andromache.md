# ANDROMACHE — "The Wife"

**POV Status:** Secondary (Season 4)

Added for the fall of Troy. Hector is dead. Her son will be thrown from the walls. Her chapters are about a woman stripped of everything, finding steel inside herself.

## Book One Events

Andromache appears as a supporting figure throughout Book One, primarily as Hector's wife and confidante during the early stages of the war.

**Chapter 2: The Theft**
- Finds Hector on the walls at dawn after he has spent the night processing the news that Paris has taken Helen and the treasury of Sparta
- Asks if Helen can be returned before the Greeks come; Hector explains that Paris also stole Sparta's gold, making forgiveness impossible
- Learns about the oath that binds all Greek kings to defend Helen's husband
- Asks "How long do we have?" and Hector estimates a year, maybe less, before a thousand ships and a hundred thousand men arrive
- Tells Hector "The walls have never fallen," trying to offer hope
- Hector confides that he wanted to kill Paris when he read the message, and that Cassandra had begged him to kill Paris weeks earlier but the curse made him unable to hold onto her warnings
- Stays on the walls to watch Paris's ship arrive with Helen

**Chapter 6: The Wall**
- Wakes when horns signal the Greek raid on a southern village (five years into the siege)
- Waits at the palace gates when Hector returns at dawn carrying a dead girl he found in the ruins
- Takes the dead child from his exhausted arms after he insists on seeing their son Astyanax first
- Leads him to the nursery where their three-year-old son sleeps peacefully, unaware of the horrors outside
- Finds the girl's surviving grandmother in the city and delivers the news of the child's death
- Later that night, discusses the future with Hector: when he despairs about Cassandra's prophecy that "children not yet born will pick up swords," she responds with fierce resolve
- Declares they will protect Astyanax, survive, and "make them pay for every single one"
- Comforts Hector and urges him to sleep while he can

Throughout Book One, Andromache serves as Hector's emotional anchor, offering both comfort and steel. She evolves from asking hopeful questions about avoiding war to accepting its reality with grim determination. Her focus on protecting Astyanax foreshadows the tragic fate Cassandra has already prophesied—that the Greeks will throw her son from the walls after Troy falls.

## Book 1 Audit

### Vocal Style Assessment

**Consistency: STRONG**

Andromache's voice remains consistent across her two appearances (Chapter 2 and Chapter 6). Her dialogue is characterized by:

1. **Pragmatic questioning** - She asks direct, practical questions: "Can we give her back? Before they come for her?" (Ch. 2) and "How long can this go on?" (Ch. 6). This pattern holds.

2. **Understated strength** - She offers hope without being naive: "The walls have never fallen" (Ch. 2) and "Then we protect him. We do what we can" (Ch. 6). Both moments show her balancing realism with resolve.

3. **Physical grounding of emotion** - She uses touch meaningfully: "Andromache's hand found his" (Ch. 2), "she stood, took his face in her hands" (Ch. 6). This tactile quality is consistent.

4. **Fierce protectiveness** - Her most powerful line comes in Chapter 6: "And we make them pay for every single one." This tracks well from her quieter "The walls have never fallen" optimism to hardened resolve after five years of war.

**No problematic dialogue detected.** Her voice matures appropriately between the pre-war scenes and year-five scenes without losing its core identity.

### Continuity Assessment

**No continuity errors found.**

- In Chapter 2, Andromache learns about the oath binding Greek kings and Hector's estimate of "a year, maybe less" before invasion. This knowledge is not referenced later but also not contradicted.
- In Chapter 6, Astyanax is described as "three years old now" - the timeline states five years have passed since the fleet arrived, and Astyanax is mentioned as sleeping in the nursery when the fleet first appeared (Ch. 5). This creates a minor timing question: if Astyanax was already in the nursery during the landing (year 0), he would be at least 5 by Chapter 6. **POTENTIAL ISSUE**: The profile says Astyanax is three in Chapter 6, but Chapter 5 (the landing, year 0) already shows him sleeping in a nursery, implying he existed before the war started. If the war has been ongoing for five years by Chapter 6, his age should be older. **Recommend clarifying Astyanax's birth timeline.**
- Andromache appropriately does not know about Cassandra's prophecy regarding Astyanax being thrown from the walls - this information stays with Hector, who heard it in Chapter 1 and has never told her. Good compartmentalization of knowledge.

### Arc Strengthening Opportunities

**Current Arc**: Hopeful wife asking if war can be avoided (Ch. 2) -> Hardened partner vowing revenge while protecting their son (Ch. 6)

**Missed Opportunities:**

1. **No appearance in Chapters 3-5**: Andromache is absent for approximately 75% of Book One. During the five-year time jump, she has no presence. Her transformation from hopeful to hardened happens entirely off-page.
   - **Suggestion**: Consider a brief scene in Chapter 5 (the landing) showing her reaction to the fleet's arrival, or a moment during Paris's duel where she watches from the walls. This would provide a middle beat in her arc.

2. **Her response to Cassandra's prophecy about Astyanax**: Hector learns in Chapter 1 that "they throw him from the walls" (referring to Astyanax). In Chapter 5, Cassandra again mentions "the baby flying. But not like a bird." Hector never tells Andromache. This could be strengthened:
   - **Suggestion**: In Chapter 6, when Hector mentions "Cassandra said children not yet born will pick up swords," Andromache's response "Cassandra says many things" could be expanded to show whether she knows about or suspects Cassandra's visions about Astyanax specifically. Her fierce "we protect him" would land harder if we sensed she was fighting against something she half-suspects.

3. **The dead girl as mirror**: In Chapter 6, Hector carries a dead child into the palace. Andromache takes the girl from his arms and finds her grandmother. This is effective, but:
   - **Suggestion**: A single line showing Andromache's reaction to the dead child as a mother - perhaps looking toward Astyanax's nursery, or a moment of physical reaction - would deepen the parallel between this anonymous girl and her own son's prophesied fate.

4. **Her relationship to Helen**: Andromache has no scenes with Helen in Book One, despite both being wives trapped in this situation. Given Helen's established pattern of visiting Cassandra (Ch. 6), an Andromache-Helen scene could add dimension to both characters.

### What's Working Well

1. **The "walls have never fallen" / "make them pay" bookend**: This is excellent character shorthand showing her evolution. Keep it.

2. **Physical presence**: Andromache never speaks without doing something - finding Hector on the walls, taking a dead child from his arms, leading him to the nursery. She is active, not passive. This is consistent and effective.

3. **Emotional anchor function**: The profile describes her as Hector's "emotional anchor" and this lands. Both scenes show her pulling Hector back from despair without dismissing his concerns. The line "Sleep while you can" in Chapter 6 echoes her practical nature.

4. **Appropriate restraint**: For a secondary character, less can be more. Her two appearances are well-placed at the beginning and end of Book One, framing the time period.

### Summary

Andromache is vocally consistent and free of continuity errors (pending the Astyanax age clarification). Her arc functions but could be strengthened with one additional scene in the middle chapters to show her transformation rather than skipping from hopeful to hardened. The dead-child scene in Chapter 6 is a strong setup for her eventual fate as a mother who loses everything - consider amplifying her maternal response in that moment.
