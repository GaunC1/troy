# ANDROMACHE — "The Wife"

**POV Status:** Secondary (Season 4)

Added for the fall of Troy. Hector is dead. Her son will be thrown from the walls. Her chapters are about a woman stripped of everything, finding steel inside herself.

## Book One Events

Andromache appears as a supporting figure throughout Book One, primarily as Hector's wife and confidante during the early stages of the war.

**Chapter 2: The Theft**
- Finds Hector on the walls at dawn after he has spent the night processing the news that Paris has taken Helen and the treasury of Sparta
- Asks if Helen can be returned before the Greeks come; Hector explains that Paris also stole Sparta's gold, making forgiveness impossible
- Learns about the oath that binds all Greek kings to defend Helen's husband
- Asks "How long do we have?" and Hector estimates a year, maybe less, before a thousand ships and a hundred thousand men arrive
- Tells Hector "The walls have never fallen," trying to offer hope
- Hector confides that he wanted to kill Paris when he read the message, and that Cassandra had begged him to kill Paris weeks earlier but the curse made him unable to hold onto her warnings
- Stays on the walls to watch Paris's ship arrive with Helen

**Chapter 6: The Wall**
- Wakes when horns signal the Greek raid on a southern village (five years into the siege)
- Waits at the palace gates when Hector returns at dawn carrying a dead girl he found in the ruins
- Takes the dead child from his exhausted arms after he insists on seeing their son Astyanax first
- Leads him to the nursery where their three-year-old son sleeps peacefully, unaware of the horrors outside
- Finds the girl's surviving grandmother in the city and delivers the news of the child's death
- Later that night, discusses the future with Hector: when he despairs about Cassandra's prophecy that "children not yet born will pick up swords," she responds with fierce resolve
- Declares they will protect Astyanax, survive, and "make them pay for every single one"
- Comforts Hector and urges him to sleep while he can

Throughout Book One, Andromache serves as Hector's emotional anchor, offering both comfort and steel. She evolves from asking hopeful questions about avoiding war to accepting its reality with grim determination. Her focus on protecting Astyanax foreshadows the tragic fate Cassandra has already prophesied—that the Greeks will throw her son from the walls after Troy falls.
