# ANDROMACHE — "The Wife"

**POV Status:** Secondary (Season 4)

Added for the fall of Troy. Hector is dead. Her son will be thrown from the walls. Her chapters are about a woman stripped of everything, finding steel inside herself.

## Book One Events

Andromache appears as a supporting figure throughout Book One, primarily as Hector's wife and confidante during the early stages of the war.

**Chapter 2: The Theft**
- Finds Hector on the walls at dawn after he has spent the night processing the news that Paris has taken Helen and the treasury of Sparta
- Asks if Helen can be returned before the Greeks come; Hector explains that Paris also stole Sparta's gold, making forgiveness impossible
- Learns about the oath that binds all Greek kings to defend Helen's husband
- Asks "How long do we have?" and Hector estimates a year, maybe less, before a thousand ships and a hundred thousand men arrive
- Tells Hector "The walls have never fallen," trying to offer hope
- Hector confides that he wanted to kill Paris when he read the message, and that Cassandra had begged him to kill Paris weeks earlier but the curse made him unable to hold onto her warnings
- Stays on the walls to watch Paris's ship arrive with Helen

**Chapter 6: The Wall**
- Wakes when horns signal the Greek raid on a southern village (five years into the siege)
- Waits at the palace gates when Hector returns at dawn carrying a dead girl he found in the ruins
- Takes the dead child from his exhausted arms after he insists on seeing their son Astyanax first
- Leads him to the nursery where their three-year-old son sleeps peacefully, unaware of the horrors outside
- Finds the girl's surviving grandmother in the city and delivers the news of the child's death
- Later that night, discusses the future with Hector: when he despairs about Cassandra's prophecy that "children not yet born will pick up swords," she responds with fierce resolve
- Declares they will protect Astyanax, survive, and "make them pay for every single one"
- Comforts Hector and urges him to sleep while he can

Throughout Book One, Andromache serves as Hector's emotional anchor, offering both comfort and steel. She evolves from asking hopeful questions about avoiding war to accepting its reality with grim determination. Her focus on protecting Astyanax foreshadows the tragic fate Cassandra has already prophesied—that the Greeks will throw her son from the walls after Troy falls.

## Book 1 Speech Samples

### Voice Mechanics

**Sentence structure:** Short, practical questions that cut to the heart of things ("How long do we have?"). Declarative statements of resolve without embellishment. No wasted words.

**Tense:** Present and future. She rarely dwells on the past—what matters is what comes next. Her focus is always forward, on what can be done.

**Rhythm:** Steady, even when the content is terrible. She doesn't speed up in crisis; she slows down. Her calm is active, not passive.

**What she talks about:** Practical next steps. Protection. Survival. What can be done right now, in this moment, with what they have.

**What she avoids:** False comfort. She won't say "it will be fine" when it won't. Her reassurance is in being present and capable, not in empty words.

**Emotion marker:** Steel surfacing through gentleness. She touches Hector's face before delivering hard truths. She takes the dead child from his arms with tenderness, then immediately asks about finding the family.

**Verbal tics:** Direct questions that ground Hector ("How long?"), statements of resolve ("We protect him. We survive."), the practical "if not—" that accepts dark possibilities without dwelling.

**Contrast:** Where Hector spirals into despair, Andromache anchors. Where Helen accepts blame, Andromache plans vengeance. She is the steel Hector needs but cannot give himself.

## Book 2 Arc

**Role:** The One Who Waits

Andromache's Book 2 arc deepens her position as the fixed point around which Hector's world turns—and the grinding cost of that fixedness. She is the keeper of domestic time while Hector exists in battle-time. She marks Astyanax's first steps (he fell on the fourth attempt), a milestone Hector missed. She absorbs the war's news—Achilles no longer takes ransoms—and translates it into the question Hector cannot answer: "What does that mean?"

**Chapter 1: The Weight of Waiting**
- In her chambers with Astyanax on her lap when Hector returns from another sortie
- Reports Astyanax's first steps: "He fell on the fourth."
- When Hector apologizes for missing it: "You're always sorry."
- Mentions what refugees are saying—Achilles has stopped taking ransoms
- Asks the question Hector won't answer: "What does that mean?"
- Offers what she can: "Come to bed. Astyanax will sleep through."

**Chapter 3: The Unbending**
- Waits at the entrance to her chambers with Astyanax—the same posture, the same waiting
- Grey now threads through her hair, though she is not yet twenty-five. The war is aging her faster than years should.
- Holds herself "straight-backed, unbending, because if she bent she might break"
- Watches Astyanax scream in terror at Hector's war helmet—her son does not recognize his father in armor
- Her requests grow smaller as hope shrinks: "Don't go back out. Not tonight."
- Accepts reality: "I know."
- The last thing she can ask: "Come home."
- Hector's response, worn smooth with repetition: "I always do."

**Thematic Function:**
Andromache represents the hidden war—the one fought in chambers and nurseries, measured in grey hairs and missed milestones. Her "straight-backed, unbending" posture is its own kind of armor. The domestic moments she guards (first steps, bedtime, the hope of one night together) are what Troy is supposedly fighting to protect—yet they are being destroyed by the fighting itself.

The detail of Astyanax screaming at his father's helmet is devastating foreshadowing: the instrument of Hector's protection terrifies the child it exists to protect. War has already begun to destroy what Hector loves, from the inside.

## Character Goals / Conspiracies / Missions

**Surface Goal:** Survival. Keep Hector alive. Keep Astyanax alive. Endure until the war ends.

**Deeper Goal:** Hold the center. Be the reason Hector comes home. Be the fixed point that allows him to fight without breaking. She has made herself into the domestic anchor Troy needs, but this role is slowly crushing her.

**Unspoken Goal:** Vengeance. Her line in Book 1—"we make them pay for every single one"—reveals a steel core beneath the waiting. She is not simply enduring; she is remembering. She is keeping accounts.

**What She Wants But Cannot Have:**
- Her husband present, not just briefly returned between battles
- A childhood for Astyanax that isn't measured against death
- The war to have never happened
- To be the one who acts, not the one who waits

**The Question She Carries:** In Chapter 1, she asks Hector what it means that Achilles no longer takes ransoms. He doesn't answer. She knows what it means. She wants him to say it aloud so she can stop pretending.

## Agency Analysis

**The Problem:**
Andromache is currently passive, existing in relation to Hector. She waits. She asks. She holds Astyanax. She offers comfort. She does not act in ways that shape the plot—she responds to what others do. This is historically and narratively consistent (the Iliad gives her exactly one scene), but it limits her as a character and reduces her to a symbol of What War Destroys.

**The Deeper Problem:**
Her passivity also undercuts the "steel" we've established. Book 1 promised she would "make them pay for every single one." Where is that steel in Book 2? Currently, she waits. That is not the same as planning.

**Suggestions for Active Purpose:**

1. **The Ransom Network:** Andromache could be quietly working to ransom Trojan captives back from the Greeks—gathering gold from noble families, negotiating through intermediaries, keeping track of who is taken and who can be saved. This gives her agency, connects her to the larger war effort, and sets up devastating dramatic irony: she is trying to save captives while Achilles has stopped taking ransoms.

2. **The Escape Plan:** She could be secretly preparing an escape route for Astyanax—making arrangements with allies in the countryside, hiding supplies, identifying which servants can be trusted. Not because she has given up on Hector, but because she is pragmatic enough to plan for the worst. This gives her scenes where she acts without Hector, makes decisions, takes risks.

3. **Intelligence Gathering:** The refugees who told her about Achilles—she could be cultivating them as sources. Andromache as a quiet spymaster within Troy, collecting information that Hector is too busy or too proud to gather. She knows things he doesn't because she listens to people he overlooks.

4. **The Women's Council:** She could be leading (or participating in) a council of noble Trojan women who are planning for what happens if the city falls. Where do they go? Who protects the children? What do they do if they're taken? This gives her a community beyond Hector and a sphere of influence.

5. **Confronting Cassandra:** Andromache knows Cassandra's prophecies are true—she was there when Cassandra warned about Paris, when Hector admitted he couldn't hold onto the warnings. She could be the one Trojan who seeks out Cassandra, who forces herself to listen, who asks the terrible question: "What happens to my son?" This gives her a scene of genuine agency—choosing to know the truth.

6. **The Secret Correspondence:** She could be in contact with someone outside Troy—perhaps Hector's allies, perhaps someone unexpected. Letters smuggled out. Information traded. This positions her as an actor in the larger political game, not just its victim.

**Recommended Direction:**
The most thematically resonant option is **The Ransom Network + The Escape Plan**. Andromache working to save captives while unknowingly racing against Achilles's new brutality creates tragic irony. And her quiet preparation of an escape route for Astyanax—an escape that will ultimately fail—gives her agency while preserving the tragedy. She is not passive; she is planning. The plans will not be enough.

This also sets up her Season 4 POV: when Hector dies and Troy falls, we see not just a woman stripped of everything, but a woman whose careful plans were destroyed. She did everything right. It wasn't enough.
