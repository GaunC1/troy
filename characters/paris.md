# PARIS — "The Lover"

**POV Status:** Secondary (Seasons 1-2)

Beautiful, charming, utterly unequal to the consequences of his choices. He genuinely loves Helen (or thinks he does). He's not stupid—he knows he doomed his family. He just can't face it. His chapters are studies in denial, deflection, and occasional flashes of genuine guilt.

*POV fades as he becomes less relevant. His death is reported through Hector's POV—a minor irony, since Hector outlives him by episodes.*

## Book One Events

**The Judgment (Ch. 1):** On Mount Ida, Paris is visited by Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite. He chooses Aphrodite's gift—Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world—over wisdom/victory or political power. Athena's parting words: "You already have" destroyed Troy. He abandons his flock and walks toward the city.

**The Seduction and Theft (Ch. 2):** At Sparta, Paris connects with Helen through vulnerability and honesty—both outsiders performing roles they never chose. While Menelaus hunts, Paris asks Helen to flee with him. She boards the *Aedon* at dawn; Aeneas loads Sparta's treasury alongside her. Paris believes it's a rescue; the narrative suggests it's also a calculated theft.

**The Failed Warrior (Ch. 5):** During the beach landing, Paris freezes when facing a Greek boy—unable to kill someone who sailed across the sea because of his choices. Hector saves him, then banishes him from the battlefield: "Stay in the palace. Play with your bow. Leave the fighting to people who can do it."

**The Duel (Ch. 5):** Paris accepts Menelaus's challenge to single combat, knowing he'll lose, telling Priam: "I started this... if there's any chance I can end this, I have to take it." He fights poorly and is about to die when someone (attributed to Aphrodite) breaks the truce. He survives but the war continues—his attempt at responsibility negated by divine or human intervention.

**The Guilt (Ch. 6):** Five years into the siege, Paris and Helen exist in a bubble of physical intimacy and shared guilt. After a village raid kills a child, Helen tells him their love doesn't help. His response: "It's the only thing I have."

**Character Arc:** Paris moves from naive shepherd to guilt-ridden prince. He genuinely tries to take responsibility (accepting the duel) but lacks the capacity to follow through. His denial shifts toward acknowledgment, but he remains fundamentally unequal to the consequences of his choices—loving Helen while unable to protect anyone from what that love has caused.
