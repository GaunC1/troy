# ODYSSEUS — "The Pragmatist"

**POV Status:** Primary (Every season)

**Starting State:** Clever king of a small island. Didn't want this war. Faked madness to avoid it (failed). Now committed to ending it as quickly as possible through any means necessary.

**Arc:** Reluctant participant → Ruthless strategist → War criminal → Haunted survivor

**Core Tension:** He tells himself every atrocity serves the greater good of ending the war. But he's starting to enjoy the problem-solving. The horse isn't just a solution—it's a masterpiece.

## Motivation Evolution

- S1: Find a way to go home without fighting
- S2: Win the war through cleverness, not sacrifice
- S3: Win the war through any means, the cost doesn't matter anymore
- S4: Burn it all down and pick through the ashes

## Key Relationships

- **Penelope** — the memory of home that keeps him sane, then doesn't
- **Agamemnon** — the king he serves and secretly despises
- **Achilles** — the blunt instrument he wishes he could be
- **Palamedes** — the man he murdered for being too clever

## Book One Events

**Chapter 3 - The Oath:** Introduced living peacefully on Ithaca with Penelope and infant Telemachus, building stone walls by hand. When summoned to war, he feigns madness by plowing the beach with salt. Palamedes exposes him by placing Telemachus in the plow's path; Odysseus swerves to save his son, proving his sanity. Forced to join the expedition, he coldly swears to kill Palamedes someday. At Aulis, he watches Agamemnon with suspicion, piecing together the conspiracy around the stalled fleet.

**Chapter 4 - The Blood Price:** Suspects Agamemnon's plan to sacrifice Iphigenia but remains silent, reasoning he couldn't stop it anyway. When Achilles confronts him, he defends his pragmatism: "This is war. This is what war is." Watches the sacrifice from the back of the crowd with eyes closed. Reflects afterward that "the first blood of this war was Greek... and it was a child's."

**Chapter 6 - The Wall:** Five years into the siege, he proposes raiding civilian villages for supplies - a dishonorable but necessary tactic. Walks the camp at night, unable to sleep. Encounters Palamedes during patrol; refuses his offer of collaboration, stating "I'll never forget" what happened on Ithaca. The grudge has hardened into patient certainty. By dawn, still telling himself the walls will eventually fall.

**Character Development:** Odysseus begins as a reluctant participant who treasures his simple domestic life. His forced recruitment by Palamedes plants a seed of cold vengeance that only grows harder with time. Throughout Book One, he demonstrates his defining trait: pragmatic acceptance of terrible necessities while internally calculating future retribution. He watches atrocities unfold, says nothing, and files everything away for later.
