# BRISEIS — "The Prize"

**POV Status:** Secondary (Seasons 2-3)

War captive. Passed between Achilles and Agamemnon like property. Her POV provides the ground-level view of the Greek camp—the petty politics, the casual cruelty, the soldiers who are just tired farmers who want to go home.

*Her relationship with Achilles is complicated—not Stockholm syndrome romance, not simple hatred. Something more nuanced and deeply sad.*

## Book One Events

Briseis does not appear in Book One. The narrative focuses on the origins of the war (Paris's judgment, the abduction of Helen), the gathering of the Greek forces at Aulis (including the sacrifice of Iphigenia), and the first years of the siege. While Achilles participates in raids on coastal villages in Chapter Six—raids that result in captives being taken—Briseis is not yet introduced as a character. Her story will presumably begin in a later book when she is captured and becomes central to the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon.

## Book Two Arc: The Erasure of Self

Briseis's Book Two arc traces a harrowing transformation: from wife and sister to captive to something she cannot name.

**Chapter 1: The Fall**
Opens with a domestic scene that establishes what will be lost. Briseis is at breakfast with her husband Mynes and younger brother Epistrophus in Lyrnessus. She's the one who sees the danger clearly—she warns that the Greeks are working inland, that walls won't hold against Achilles—but no one listens. When the horns sound, her warnings come true. She hides in the cellar, is dragged out by Greek soldiers, and is marched through the ruined city. She sees her brother's body by the eastern wall ("young, thin, a wisp of beard"). She sees her husband's body at the main gates ("well-dressed, merchant's rings on his fingers"). She keeps walking.

Brought to Achilles's tent, she enters a liminal space. The first nights are silent violation—his eyes fixed on the canvas above her, his weight pressing her into the camp bed, his body rolling away afterward. She learns his scars by touch in the darkness. On the fifth night, he asks her name. On the seventh, he asks if she loved her husband. She doesn't answer.

Then something shifts. He confesses he doesn't want any of this. She asks why he continues. "Because if I stop, I'll have to feel something else." The next night, when he reaches for her, she finds herself reaching back—her hand finding the scar on his shoulder blade. He looks at her, really looks, for the first time. She wakes with his arm across her waist.

**Chapter 2: The Forgetting**
The transformation accelerates. She wakes to his dawn beach walks, wears the wine-colored Thessalian dress Patroclus gave her, knows his scars by touch. When she tries to picture Mynes, "the features had gone soft, like something left in water too long." She can remember his hands, his voice—but not the face. She eats the bread Patroclus brought. She eats it all.

**Chapter 3: The Witness**
Briseis has learned to navigate the camp invisibly. She knows which paths avoid the grabbing Locrians, which cook fires have scraps, which tents belong to which kings. She understands the camp's geography and politics—Ajax the Greater vs. the Lesser, the hatred everyone conceals for Agamemnon, the way Diomedes and Odysseus eat together speaking in low voices.

She follows the crowd to Palamedes's execution, invisible as "a woman in a brown dress, one more piece of plunder." She watches them dig the pit, watches the stoning, stays to see the flies gather. Her realization: "They can do this to their own. They can do anything."

Walking back to Achilles's tent, she notes she can no longer picture Mynes's face—"just a blur where a man used to be"—but she can picture Achilles, "every line of him." She goes to fetch water. She doesn't look back.

**The Arc's Meaning:**
Her old identity is being erased. Her husband's face is dissolving. Her brother is already a body by a wall. What replaces them is not love for Achilles—it's something more troubling. She's adapting. She's surviving. And survival requires becoming someone new, someone who can live in this camp, who can reach back when Achilles reaches for her, who can watch a man stoned to death and walk away to fetch water.

## Character Goals / Conspiracies / Missions

**Conscious Goal: Survival**
Briseis's immediate purpose is staying alive and avoiding the worst the camp can offer. She has learned which soldiers to avoid, which paths to take, how to be invisible. This is not passive—it requires constant vigilance, reading situations, understanding power dynamics. Every day is navigation.

**Unconscious Goal: Finding Solid Ground**
With her old identity dissolving, Briseis is unconsciously searching for something stable to hold onto. Achilles becomes that anchor—not because she loves him, but because he is consistent, because his tent is safe compared to the alternative, because knowing his scars by touch gives her something concrete when everything else has gone soft around the edges.

**Unconscious Goal: Making Sense of What Happened**
The execution of Palamedes is crucial. She watches to understand the Greeks, to understand power, to understand what kind of world she now lives in. "They can do this to their own" is not just horror—it's information. It tells her what's possible. It shapes her survival calculus.

**What She Is Working Toward:**
She doesn't have a plan. She has no scheme for revenge or escape. What she has is a day-by-day process of learning and adapting. She is becoming someone who can survive this world—which means becoming someone her old self would not recognize.

## Agency Analysis

**Current State:**
Briseis has agency, but it is the agency of survival within extreme constraint. Her choices are real but narrow: where to walk, whether to reach back, when to look and when to look away. She is not passive—she observes, learns, adapts. But she is not driving the narrative. Things happen to her and around her; she responds.

**Strengths:**
- Her POV provides essential ground-level perspective on the Greek camp
- Her observations about camp politics and geography make her feel intelligent and aware
- Her psychological journey is compelling—the gradual erasure of her old self
- The complexity of her relationship with Achilles avoids cliche

**Weaknesses:**
- She has no goal beyond day-to-day survival
- She is not conspiring, planning, or working toward anything
- Her arc is about transformation, not action
- She witnesses events (the trial, the stoning) but does not influence them

**Suggestions for Increasing Perceived Agency:**

1. **Give Her Knowledge That Matters:** Make her observations pay off. Perhaps she notices something during the Palamedes trial that others miss—she sees where Odysseus's eyes go, sees him throw his stone at the pit's edge. Later, this knowledge could become leverage or danger.

2. **Create a Secret Purpose:** Even a small, quiet goal would change the reading. Perhaps she is hiding something—an object, a piece of information, a skill. Perhaps she learns something about Achilles that could be valuable to someone. The goal doesn't need to drive the plot, but its existence would make her feel more purposeful.

3. **Let Her Make a Choice That Costs Something:** When she reaches back in Chapter 1, that's a choice—but it costs her nothing external. A choice that has real consequences (protecting another captive, refusing something, taking a risk) would increase her agency substantially.

4. **Use Her Invisibility as a Weapon:** Her ability to move through the camp unseen is a skill. In Book 2, she uses it only to observe. In later books, she could use it to gather information, carry messages, or position herself strategically. The same survival skills that make her invisible could make her valuable—or dangerous.

5. **Give Her a Relationship Outside Achilles:** Her entire emotional world is currently defined by what she has lost (Mynes, Epistrophus) and what she is becoming (Achilles's woman). A connection with another character—another captive, Patroclus, even an enemy—would give her somewhere to direct purpose beyond survival.

6. **Let Her Interior Voice Drive a Scene:** Currently, she watches and thinks. A scene where her decision changes the outcome—even a small outcome—would demonstrate that her observations lead to action.

**The Core Question:**
Is Briseis a character who acts, or a lens through which we see the camp? In Book 2, she is primarily a lens. This is not a failure—her perspective is valuable, her psychology is rich, her transformation is moving. But if she is to feel like a protagonist rather than a witness, she needs something to want and something to do about wanting it.
