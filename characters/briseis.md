# BRISEIS — "The Prize"

**POV Status:** Secondary (Seasons 2-3)

War captive. Passed between Achilles and Agamemnon like property. Her POV provides the ground-level view of the Greek camp—the petty politics, the casual cruelty, the soldiers who are just tired farmers who want to go home.

*Her relationship with Achilles is complicated—not Stockholm syndrome romance, not simple hatred. Something more nuanced and deeply sad.*

## Book One Events

Briseis does not appear in Book One. The narrative focuses on the origins of the war (Paris's judgment, the abduction of Helen), the gathering of the Greek forces at Aulis (including the sacrifice of Iphigenia), and the first years of the siege. While Achilles participates in raids on coastal villages in Chapter Six—raids that result in captives being taken—Briseis is not yet introduced as a character. Her story will presumably begin in a later book when she is captured and becomes central to the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon.
