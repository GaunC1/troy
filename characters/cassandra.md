# CASSANDRA — "The Prophet"

**POV Status:** Primary (Every season)

**Starting State:** Princess of Troy, cursed by Apollo to see the future and never be believed. Not "mad"—exhausted. She's been screaming warnings for years. Now she mostly mutters.

**Arc:** Ignored prophet → Bitter observer → Resigned witness → Enslaved survivor

**Core Tension:** She knows everything that will happen. She's stopped trying to prevent it. Her chapters are dramatic irony machines—she comments on events we know are doomed, provides context others lack, watches the tragedy unfold with tired eyes.

## Motivation Evolution

- S1: One last attempt to warn them (it fails)
- S2: Document what's happening, bear witness
- S3: Find someone, anyone, who will listen (Helen, briefly)
- S4: Survive the sack, knowing exactly what Agamemnon will do to her

## Key Relationships

- **Priam** — the father who loves her but can't believe her
- **Hector** — the brother who half-believes but can't act on it
- **Helen** — the only person who starts to really listen
- **Agamemnon** — the man who will own her, then die for it

## Book One Events

Cassandra's arc in Book One establishes her as the tragic prophet whose warnings fall on deaf ears, watching the seeds of Troy's destruction take root.

**Chapter 1:** Wakes from a vision of Paris's judgment on Mount Ida. Tells guards to kill Paris before he enters the city; they dismiss her as mad. When Hector visits, she begs him to murder Paris, describing the fall of Troy and Astyanax being thrown from the walls. Hector briefly believes her, but the curse pulls the knowledge away. Later, she has a vision of Paris and Helen's fateful first meeting in Sparta, seeing "the golden thread" of doom connecting them.

**Chapter 2:** When Helen arrives in Troy, their eyes meet across the distance. Helen senses Cassandra knows "everything. How this ends."

**Chapter 3:** Visions of the Greek mobilization wake her. She confronts Priam, Paris, and the council about the thousand ships gathering at Aulis, warning that Agamemnon wants to destroy Troy. Dismissed again. In the corridor, Helen approaches her. Cassandra recognizes a kindred spirit: "We're the same. Both of us seeing things clearly in a world that refuses to look." She also foresees Iphigenia's sacrifice.

**Chapter 5:** Finds Hector on the walls after Paris's failed duel. Delivers cryptic prophecies: a horse "full of teeth," and the baby "flying. But not like a bird." Predicts the war will last until "children who aren't born yet pick up swords."

**Chapter 6:** Helen visits her tower regularly, bringing food and companionship. Cassandra tells her the horse is "getting closer." In the final scene, she watches from the walls, seeing visions of the wooden horse at the gates, Astyanax falling, and fire consuming everything. Her arc concludes with resigned witness: the doom she predicted is unfolding, and she can only watch.
