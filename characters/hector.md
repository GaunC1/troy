# HECTOR — "The Defender"

**POV Status:** Primary (Every season)

**Starting State:** The good son. The good husband. The good prince. Loves his city, his family, his people. Privately believes Paris should be handed over to the Greeks. Publicly defends him because family is everything.

**Arc:** Dutiful son → Reluctant warrior → Desperate protector → Sacrificial offering

**Core Tension:** He knows Troy will fall. He's known since the beginning. Everything he does is buying time, protecting his family for one more day. His "heroism" is actually a slow suicide.

## Motivation Evolution

- S1: Keep the peace, control the damage Paris caused
- S2: Protect Troy's walls, give his son a future
- S3: Kill enough Greeks to force a negotiated surrender
- S4: Die in a way that might make Achilles spare his family (it won't)

## Key Relationships

- **Andromache** — the life he's fighting for and knows he'll lose
- **Paris** — the brother he loves and resents
- **Priam** — the father he can never disappoint
- **Achilles** — the death that's been waiting for him

## Book One Events

**Chapter 1:** Visits Cassandra in her tower after Paris's return. She begs him to kill Paris to prevent Troy's destruction, warning that his son Astyanax will be thrown from the walls. For a moment Hector believes her, but the curse takes hold and he forgets her warnings. He cannot act against his brother.

**Chapter 2:** Receives news of Paris stealing Helen and Sparta's treasury. Spends the night on the walls processing the betrayal. Confides to Andromache that he wanted to kill Paris but couldn't—because Paris is family, because their father would never forgive him, and because Cassandra had told him to (which the curse made him dismiss). Watches Paris's triumphant return with Helen, unable to intervene. Begins preparing Troy's defenses.

**Chapter 3:** Mentioned as doubling the watch and reinforcing walls. Present in the throne room when Cassandra warns about the thousand ships. Tells her "it's what I can do" when she says his preparations won't be enough.

**Chapter 5:** Commands the beach defense when the Greek fleet arrives. Witnesses Achilles's terrifying combat prowess firsthand—their eyes meet across the battlefield in a moment of mutual recognition. Orders the retreat to save his army. Confronts Paris after learning his brother froze in combat and had to be rescued. Delivers a brutal assessment: Paris is "worse than no use—you're a liability" and orders him to stay off the battlefield. Later encounters Cassandra on the walls, who speaks of a horse "full of teeth" and his baby "flying, but not like a bird"—prophecies of the Trojan Horse and Astyanax's death he cannot understand.

**Chapter 6:** Five years into the siege. Leads a cavalry force to intercept Greek raiders but arrives too late—the village is destroyed. Finds a dead girl clutching a wooden horse toy and carries her body all the way back to Troy. The experience breaks something in him. He tells Andromache: "I thought I understood... I didn't know anything." Struggles with the reality that the walls protect the city but not the people beyond them. Confides his fear that Cassandra's prophecy of a decade-long war may be true, asking "What if our son grows up in this siege, never knowing anything but war?"

**Character Development:** Book One establishes Hector as the dutiful protector trapped between family loyalty and clear-eyed understanding of Troy's doom. His arc shows him moving from reluctant acceptance of Paris's return, to bitter resentment of the war his brother caused, to grinding exhaustion as the siege wears on. His encounters with Cassandra plant seeds of dread he cannot consciously retain, while his first glimpse of Achilles marks the death that awaits him.

## Book 1 Speech Samples

### Voice Mechanics

**Sentence structure:** Terse commands in crisis ("Fall back. Now."), longer when explaining consequences to those who don't want to hear them. He builds logical chains—if this, then this, then this—laying out doom step by step.

**Tense:** Present for orders, past for accounting the dead. He speaks of the future only in terms of preparation, never hope.

**Rhythm:** Military cadence. Clipped when commanding, slower and heavier when the weight of what he knows presses down. His pauses carry meaning.

**What he talks about:** Costs. Numbers of dead. What happens next. He translates every decision into bodies—lives lost, lives that will be lost.

**What he avoids:** Self-pity. He never says "I" when describing his burden. It's always "we" or "Troy" or "the men." His personal despair surfaces only with Andromache.

**Emotion marker:** Flatness that breaks. He maintains control until he doesn't—and when it cracks, it's a single sentence of raw truth before he locks it down again.

**Verbal tics:** "I know what it'll do" (accepting bad options), "The bill came due" (accounting for Paris's choices), questions that aren't really questions.

**Contrast:** Where Achilles seeks worthy opponents, Hector calculates survival. Where Paris deflects responsibility, Hector tallies it.

## Book Two Arc: The Father/Warrior Split

Book Two deepens Hector's tragedy by externalizing his internal conflict. The war is no longer just something happening outside the walls—it has invaded his home, his family, his very identity.

**The Burden of Command:**
- Opens receiving refugees from Lyrnessus at dusk. His terse observation—"Fifth ally city this month"—reveals the mathematics of attrition he constantly calculates. He gives orders for housing, food, a healer, because duty is all he has left.
- Returns home to discover he missed Astyanax's first steps. Andromache's quiet accusation—"You're always sorry"—cuts deeper than any wound. He cannot be both the protector on the walls and the father in the nursery.
- Andromache shares what the refugees whispered: Achilles no longer takes ransoms. He simply kills. The death waiting for Hector grows more monstrous with each report.
- Standing at his window, Hector surveys what he defends: temples, palaces, and the cramped houses where refugees crowd together. The city is swelling with the displaced even as his ability to protect it shrinks.

**The Helmet Scene (Chapter 3):**
The central image of Book Two. Hector returns from battle—8 dead, 12 wounded, the mathematics of attrition made flesh—with blood still on his armor. His son sees him and screams. Not a startled cry but terror. Astyanax looks at the bronze helmet and sees "a monster's face, a killer's face."

This is Hector's greatest fear made visible: that the war has already taken him from his son. That what he does outside the walls has transformed him into something his own child cannot recognize.

He removes the helmet. "It's me, little one." The boy reaches for him, recognizing his father only when the warrior's mask is gone.

Andromache: "Don't go back out."
"I have to."

He picks up the helmet—"The bronze closed around his face like a cage"—and walks back to the walls while his son cries behind him. He chooses Troy over his family, knowing that if he doesn't, there will be no family to choose.

**Thematic Development:**
- The helmet becomes a symbol of the transformation war demands. To protect his son, Hector must become something his son cannot love.
- The "cage" imagery reinforces his entrapment: duty is a prison he locks himself into, again and again.
- Unlike Achilles, who puts on armor to become more himself, Hector puts on armor to become less—to suppress the father, the husband, the man who would rather stay.

## Character Goals / Conspiracies / Missions

**What Hector Wants:**
1. **Immediate:** Survive each day. Keep the walls manned. Manage the mathematics of attrition so Troy outlasts Greek patience.
2. **Personal:** Be present for his son's life. Watch Astyanax grow. Be a father, not just a protector.
3. **Hidden:** Part of him wants to hand Paris over. End the war with a single sacrifice. He will never do it—but he thinks about it.
4. **Deepest:** To die in a way that matters. If Troy must fall, perhaps his death can buy something—a negotiated surrender, his family's safe passage, anything.

**What He's Working Toward:**
- A war of attrition the Greeks cannot win. He doesn't need victory; he needs the Greeks to decide the cost is too high.
- Alliance maintenance: keeping Priam's network of vassal cities loyal even as Achilles destroys them one by one.
- Preparing the next generation: training younger warriors, because he knows he won't survive to see the war's end.

**Choices He Makes:**
- Chooses duty over family, repeatedly. Each choice costs him something he can never reclaim.
- Chooses to protect Paris despite knowing Paris caused this. Family loyalty as a form of self-destruction.
- Chooses honesty with Andromache. She is the only person who sees the man beneath the bronze.
- Chooses the walls. Always the walls. Always back to the walls.

## Agency Analysis

**The Problem:**
Hector is fundamentally reactive. War comes to him; he doesn't choose it. Achilles hunts; Hector defends. Paris acts; Hector cleans up. Even his death will be something that happens to him—Achilles chasing, Hector running, then caught.

This makes him sympathetic but potentially passive as a protagonist. He's the load-bearing pillar of Troy, but pillars don't move.

**Possible Proactive Elements:**

1. **A Secret Negotiation:**
   - Hector could be conducting backchannel negotiations with someone in the Greek camp—perhaps through neutral parties or during truces. Not to surrender Paris, but to establish terms: if Troy falls, what happens to the civilians? To the women and children?
   - This gives him a secret mission that's morally complex. He's planning for defeat while publicly insisting on victory. It's realistic and tragic.

2. **The Paris Problem:**
   - Rather than simply resenting Paris, Hector could be actively working to minimize his brother's influence. Keeping him off the walls. Maneuvering him away from council decisions. Quietly preparing for a Troy that might have to sacrifice Paris.
   - This creates internal political conflict and gives Hector agency within his own family.

3. **Building a Succession:**
   - Hector knows he'll die before Astyanax grows up. He could be actively cultivating a protector for his son—someone who will look after Andromache and the boy when he's gone. Aeneas? A loyal captain?
   - This forward-looking project gives him something to work toward beyond daily survival.

4. **The Tactical Innovation:**
   - Hector could be developing new strategies to counter Achilles specifically—studying his patterns, preparing traps, creating contingencies. Not because he thinks he can win, but because he needs to buy more days.
   - This makes his military role more active and shows him trying to shape events rather than just respond.

5. **The Walls Have Ears:**
   - Hector could be running Troy's intelligence network. He knows things other characters don't—Greek movements, internal dissension in Agamemnon's camp, which allies are wavering.
   - This positions him as the practical center of Troy's defense, the man who sees the whole board.

**Recommendation:**
Layer in elements 1, 2, and 4. Give Hector a secret negotiation with someone in the Greek camp (perhaps Odysseus, who respects him, or a minor herald). Show him actively marginalizing Paris. Let him develop specific plans to neutralize Achilles, even if they fail. These additions preserve his essential tragedy—the good man trapped by duty—while giving him choices that matter.
