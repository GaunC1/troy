# HECTOR — "The Defender"

**POV Status:** Primary (Every season)

**Starting State:** The good son. The good husband. The good prince. Loves his city, his family, his people. Privately believes Paris should be handed over to the Greeks. Publicly defends him because family is everything.

**Arc:** Dutiful son → Reluctant warrior → Desperate protector → Sacrificial offering

**Core Tension:** He knows Troy will fall. He's known since the beginning. Everything he does is buying time, protecting his family for one more day. His "heroism" is actually a slow suicide.

## Motivation Evolution

- S1: Keep the peace, control the damage Paris caused
- S2: Protect Troy's walls, give his son a future
- S3: Kill enough Greeks to force a negotiated surrender
- S4: Die in a way that might make Achilles spare his family (it won't)

## Key Relationships

- **Andromache** — the life he's fighting for and knows he'll lose
- **Paris** — the brother he loves and resents
- **Priam** — the father he can never disappoint
- **Achilles** — the death that's been waiting for him

## Book One Events

**Chapter 1:** Visits Cassandra in her tower after Paris's return. She begs him to kill Paris to prevent Troy's destruction, warning that his son Astyanax will be thrown from the walls. For a moment Hector believes her, but the curse takes hold and he forgets her warnings. He cannot act against his brother.

**Chapter 2:** Receives news of Paris stealing Helen and Sparta's treasury. Spends the night on the walls processing the betrayal. Confides to Andromache that he wanted to kill Paris but couldn't—because Paris is family, because their father would never forgive him, and because Cassandra had told him to (which the curse made him dismiss). Watches Paris's triumphant return with Helen, unable to intervene. Begins preparing Troy's defenses.

**Chapter 3:** Mentioned as doubling the watch and reinforcing walls. Present in the throne room when Cassandra warns about the thousand ships. Tells her "it's what I can do" when she says his preparations won't be enough.

**Chapter 5:** Commands the beach defense when the Greek fleet arrives. Witnesses Achilles's terrifying combat prowess firsthand—their eyes meet across the battlefield in a moment of mutual recognition. Orders the retreat to save his army. Confronts Paris after learning his brother froze in combat and had to be rescued. Delivers a brutal assessment: Paris is "worse than no use—you're a liability" and orders him to stay off the battlefield. Later encounters Cassandra on the walls, who speaks of a horse "full of teeth" and his baby "flying, but not like a bird"—prophecies of the Trojan Horse and Astyanax's death he cannot understand.

**Chapter 6:** Five years into the siege. Leads a cavalry force to intercept Greek raiders but arrives too late—the village is destroyed. Finds a dead girl clutching a wooden horse toy and carries her body all the way back to Troy. The experience breaks something in him. He tells Andromache: "I thought I understood... I didn't know anything." Struggles with the reality that the walls protect the city but not the people beyond them. Confides his fear that Cassandra's prophecy of a decade-long war may be true, asking "What if our son grows up in this siege, never knowing anything but war?"

**Character Development:** Book One establishes Hector as the dutiful protector trapped between family loyalty and clear-eyed understanding of Troy's doom. His arc shows him moving from reluctant acceptance of Paris's return, to bitter resentment of the war his brother caused, to grinding exhaustion as the siege wears on. His encounters with Cassandra plant seeds of dread he cannot consciously retain, while his first glimpse of Achilles marks the death that awaits him.

## Book 1 Speech Samples

### Voice Mechanics

**Sentence structure:** Terse commands in crisis ("Fall back. Now."), longer when explaining consequences to those who don't want to hear them. He builds logical chains—if this, then this, then this—laying out doom step by step.

**Tense:** Present for orders, past for accounting the dead. He speaks of the future only in terms of preparation, never hope.

**Rhythm:** Military cadence. Clipped when commanding, slower and heavier when the weight of what he knows presses down. His pauses carry meaning.

**What he talks about:** Costs. Numbers of dead. What happens next. He translates every decision into bodies—lives lost, lives that will be lost.

**What he avoids:** Self-pity. He never says "I" when describing his burden. It's always "we" or "Troy" or "the men." His personal despair surfaces only with Andromache.

**Emotion marker:** Flatness that breaks. He maintains control until he doesn't—and when it cracks, it's a single sentence of raw truth before he locks it down again.

**Verbal tics:** "I know what it'll do" (accepting bad options), "The bill came due" (accounting for Paris's choices), questions that aren't really questions.

**Contrast:** Where Achilles seeks worthy opponents, Hector calculates survival. Where Paris deflects responsibility, Hector tallies it.
