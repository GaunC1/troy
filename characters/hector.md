# HECTOR — "The Defender"

**POV Status:** Primary (Every season)

**Starting State:** The good son. The good husband. The good prince. Loves his city, his family, his people. Privately believes Paris should be handed over to the Greeks. Publicly defends him because family is everything.

**Arc:** Dutiful son → Reluctant warrior → Desperate protector → Sacrificial offering

**Core Tension:** He knows Troy will fall. He's known since the beginning. Everything he does is buying time, protecting his family for one more day. His "heroism" is actually a slow suicide.

## Motivation Evolution

- S1: Keep the peace, control the damage Paris caused
- S2: Protect Troy's walls, give his son a future
- S3: Kill enough Greeks to force a negotiated surrender
- S4: Die in a way that might make Achilles spare his family (it won't)

## Key Relationships

- **Andromache** — the life he's fighting for and knows he'll lose
- **Paris** — the brother he loves and resents
- **Priam** — the father he can never disappoint
- **Achilles** — the death that's been waiting for him

## Book One Events

**Chapter 1:** Visits Cassandra in her tower after Paris's return. She begs him to kill Paris to prevent Troy's destruction, warning that his son Astyanax will be thrown from the walls. For a moment Hector believes her, but the curse takes hold and he forgets her warnings. He cannot act against his brother.

**Chapter 2:** Receives news of Paris stealing Helen and Sparta's treasury. Spends the night on the walls processing the betrayal. Confides to Andromache that he wanted to kill Paris but couldn't—because Paris is family, because their father would never forgive him, and because Cassandra had told him to (which the curse made him dismiss). Watches Paris's triumphant return with Helen, unable to intervene. Begins preparing Troy's defenses.

**Chapter 3:** Mentioned as doubling the watch and reinforcing walls. Present in the throne room when Cassandra warns about the thousand ships. Tells her "it's what I can do" when she says his preparations won't be enough.

**Chapter 5:** Commands the beach defense when the Greek fleet arrives. Witnesses Achilles's terrifying combat prowess firsthand—their eyes meet across the battlefield in a moment of mutual recognition. Orders the retreat to save his army. Confronts Paris after learning his brother froze in combat and had to be rescued. Delivers a brutal assessment: Paris is "worse than no use—you're a liability" and orders him to stay off the battlefield. Later encounters Cassandra on the walls, who speaks of a horse "full of teeth" and his baby "flying, but not like a bird"—prophecies of the Trojan Horse and Astyanax's death he cannot understand.

**Chapter 6:** Five years into the siege. Leads a cavalry force to intercept Greek raiders but arrives too late—the village is destroyed. Finds a dead girl clutching a wooden horse toy and carries her body all the way back to Troy. The experience breaks something in him. He tells Andromache: "I thought I understood... I didn't know anything." Struggles with the reality that the walls protect the city but not the people beyond them. Confides his fear that Cassandra's prophecy of a decade-long war may be true, asking "What if our son grows up in this siege, never knowing anything but war?"

**Character Development:** Book One establishes Hector as the dutiful protector trapped between family loyalty and clear-eyed understanding of Troy's doom. His arc shows him moving from reluctant acceptance of Paris's return, to bitter resentment of the war his brother caused, to grinding exhaustion as the siege wears on. His encounters with Cassandra plant seeds of dread he cannot consciously retain, while his first glimpse of Achilles marks the death that awaits him.

## Book 1 Audit

### Vocal Style Assessment

**Consistency: STRONG**

Hector's voice remains remarkably consistent across all his appearances. His dialogue is characterized by:

1. **Clipped, declarative statements** - He speaks in short, direct sentences that convey authority and exhaustion simultaneously.
   - Chapter 2: "If it were only the woman, perhaps."
   - Chapter 5: "I know what it'll do. Do it anyway."
   - Chapter 6: "There's always more war. There's always more to do."

2. **Fatalistic pragmatism** - He accepts terrible realities while still acting.
   - Chapter 2: "You can forgive a man who steals your wife. You cannot forgive a man who makes you look like a fool."
   - Chapter 3: "Maybe not. But it's what I can do."
   - Chapter 5: "You're no use out there. You're worse than no use—you're a liability."

3. **Emotional restraint that occasionally cracks** - He maintains composure but reveals vulnerability to Andromache and Cassandra.
   - Chapter 2: "I wanted to kill him... I couldn't hold onto it."
   - Chapter 6: "I thought I understood... I didn't know anything."

**No off-character dialogue detected.** Every line fits his profile as the exhausted protector who knows the outcome but keeps fighting anyway.

### Continuity Assessment

**Status: NO ERRORS DETECTED**

Timeline and information access are handled correctly:

1. **Chapter 1:** Hector visits Cassandra after Paris's return. He is told about Astyanax being thrown from the walls, experiences a moment of believing her, then forgets due to the curse. This correctly establishes that he cannot retain Cassandra's warnings.

2. **Chapter 2:** He learns of the theft via messenger scroll BEFORE Paris arrives. He processes this overnight on the walls. He correctly references the oath of Helen's suitors and understands its implications. He mentions to Andromache that "Cassandra told me to" kill Paris "three weeks ago" - this aligns with the Chapter 1 timeline.

3. **Chapter 3:** He is present in the throne room when Cassandra warns about the thousand ships. His line "it's what I can do" about his preparations is consistent with his pragmatic character.

4. **Chapter 5:** His first encounter with Achilles is handled well - he recognizes the threat, orders retreat, and later reflects on the mutual recognition. He correctly has knowledge of the beach landing and can assess Paris's failure because he witnessed it.

5. **Chapter 6:** The five-year time jump is clearly established. His knowledge reflects the accumulated weight of the siege. His reference to Cassandra's prophecy about "children not yet born" picking up swords correctly recalls her Chapter 5 warning.

**One minor note:** In Chapter 2, Hector mentions "Cassandra told me to [kill Paris]. Three weeks ago." The profile says this happened in Chapter 1 right after Paris's return. The "three weeks" timing is not explicitly established in Chapter 1, but this works if we assume Paris's return was about three weeks before the Sparta theft. This is internally consistent.

### Arc Strengthening Opportunities

**1. The Cassandra Encounters Could Hit Harder**

The profile establishes that Hector's encounters with Cassandra "plant seeds of dread he cannot consciously retain." This is executed well in Chapter 1, where we see the curse take hold. However, in Chapter 5, when Cassandra speaks of "a horse full of teeth" and his baby "flying, but not like a bird," Hector's reaction could be deepened.

*Current (Chapter 5, lines 788-801):*
> Hector felt something cold touch his spine. "What baby? What are you talking about?"
> But Cassandra was looking past him now...

*Suggestion:* Consider adding a beat where Hector almost grasps the meaning - perhaps a flash of the same dread he felt in Chapter 1 - before it slips away. This would reinforce the tragedy of the curse and create a stronger echo between the two Cassandra scenes.

**2. The Achilles Recognition Moment is Excellent - Consider Deepening**

The profile states: "His first glimpse of Achilles marks the death that's been waiting for him." This is beautifully executed in Chapter 5:

> Their eyes met.
> The noise of battle faded...
> Hector felt something cold move through his chest. Recognition. Understanding.
> *This is the man.*

This works perfectly. However, there's no callback to this moment in Chapter 6 when Hector learns it was Achilles who led the village raid. A brief internal reference - perhaps while carrying the dead girl - could strengthen the arc by showing Achilles is now connected to his growing despair, not just his future death.

**3. The Chapter 6 Breakdown is the Arc's Strongest Moment**

The scene where Hector carries the dead girl all the way back to Troy, then stands in his son's nursery, is the most powerful illustration of his "Core Tension" from the profile: "He knows Troy will fall... Everything he does is buying time, protecting his family for one more day."

The line "I thought I understood... I didn't know anything" perfectly captures the shift from "Reluctant warrior" toward "Desperate protector" in his arc.

**4. Consider Adding an Internal Moment About Paris's Survival**

In Chapter 5, when Paris is saved from Menelaus by the truce-breaking charge, Hector is angry about the broken truce but we don't see his deeper feelings about Paris surviving. Given his Chapter 2 confession to Andromache ("I wanted to kill him"), this would be an opportunity to show his complicated feelings - relief mixed with resentment, love mixed with frustration that the war continues.

**5. His Relationship with Andromache is Well-Balanced**

The profile identifies Andromache as "the life he's fighting for and knows he'll lose." Their scenes in Chapters 2 and 6 effectively show her as both his confidante and the person who keeps him functional. The Chapter 6 exchange where she says "Then we watch. And we remember. And we make them pay" shows her hardening alongside him, which is excellent supporting characterization.

### What's Working Well

1. **The "slow suicide" element** from his Core Tension is consistently present. Every scene shows him doing his duty while knowing it's futile.

2. **His relationship with Paris** evolves believably from reluctant acceptance (Ch. 1-2) to bitter resentment (Ch. 5) to weary acceptance that nothing will change (Ch. 5-6).

3. **His voice never breaks character.** Whether commanding troops, confronting his brother, or confiding in his wife, he sounds like the same exhausted, dutiful man.

4. **The physical details** reinforce his state: red-rimmed eyes (Ch. 2), walking like a soldier even in peacetime (Ch. 1), his knees aching from kneeling beside the dead girl (Ch. 6).

5. **His isolation is palpable.** He can only truly speak to Andromache, and even then, he holds back. His interactions with Cassandra are particularly tragic - he hears her, almost believes her, and then the knowledge slips away.

### Summary

Hector's characterization in Book One is exceptionally consistent and well-executed. His vocal style is distinctive and maintained throughout. There are no continuity errors in his knowledge or timeline. The arc from "Reluctant warrior" toward "Desperate protector" is clearly underway, with the Chapter 6 village raid serving as the turning point. Minor opportunities exist to deepen certain moments, particularly his reactions to Cassandra's prophecies and his conflicted feelings about Paris's survival, but these are enhancements rather than corrections. The character is working as designed.
