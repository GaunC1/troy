# ACHILLES — "The Weapon"

**POV Status:** Primary (Every season)

**Starting State:** Young, beautiful, absolutely certain of his own glory. He knows he will die at Troy and has chosen this—fame over long life. He sees war as the stage for his legend.

**Arc:** Glory-seeker → Disillusioned soldier → Grief-shattered man → Death-seeker

**Core Tension:** He chose a short, glorious life. But glory feels hollow when his only real connection (Patroclus) is taken. By the end, he doesn't want to die gloriously anymore—he just wants to die.

## Motivation Evolution

- S1: Prove himself the greatest warrior who ever lived
- S2: Maintain his honor against Agamemnon's insults
- S3: Destroy everything Hector loves, then himself
- S4: Already dead inside, going through motions until Paris's arrow

## Key Relationships

- **Patroclus** — the only person who sees him as human, not a weapon
- **Agamemnon** — the king who treats him as a tool
- **Hector** — the mirror—everything Achilles could have been
- **Briseis** — the woman who shows him what he's become

## Book One Events

**Chapter 3 (The Oath):** Achilles agrees to join the expedition with his Myrmidons. His reputation precedes him - rumors call him half-divine, invulnerable, the greatest warrior of his generation - though at 19, he has never seen real battle. Agamemnon considers him for a marriage alliance with Iphigenia.

**Chapter 4 (The Blood Price):** At Aulis, Achilles trains obsessively at dawn, restless and worried the becalmed fleet means his choice of glory over long life was for nothing. He confides his existential fears to Patroclus. When Iphigenia arrives believing she will marry him, Achilles discovers Agamemnon used his name to lure her to sacrifice. He storms the king's tent, physically fighting through guards, and confronts Agamemnon in a pivotal scene that establishes their antagonism. Outmatched by Agamemnon's forces, Achilles vows he will never forget. That night, he makes Patroclus promise to kill him if he ever becomes like Agamemnon - putting necessity above honor. After the sacrifice, Achilles refuses to watch but hears everything. He sails for Troy haunted, vowing to never sacrifice his humanity for expedience.

**Chapter 5 (First Blood):** As Troy appears on the horizon, Achilles tells Patroclus he recognizes this as the place where he will die. He is first off the ship, killing 17 men in the beach landing with supernatural skill. He and Hector lock eyes across the battlefield - a moment of mutual recognition that foreshadows their fated conflict. Afterward, Achilles skips Agamemnon's council. He confesses disappointment in Hector: he hoped for someone who would just come at him without calculating. His hunger for a worthy opponent is established.

**Chapter 6 (The Wall):** Five years into the siege, Achilles has visibly changed - leaner, harder, something hungry in his eyes. He leads raids on Trojan villages for supplies, confessing to Odysseus that the work feels hollow. He came to fight warriors but is butchering farmers. His disillusionment deepens as he questions whether the walls will ever truly fall. The glory-seeker of Chapter 4 is becoming the disillusioned soldier of his arc.

## Book 1 Speech Samples

### Voice Mechanics

**Sentence structure:** Short, declarative sentences when certain ("I'm ready. I want to be ready."). Longer, searching sentences when doubting himself, often ending in questions. Rarely qualifies statements—he speaks in absolutes.

**Tense:** Present tense almost exclusively. Achilles lives in the immediate moment; the past is irrelevant and the future is already decided.

**Rhythm:** Blunt force. No diplomatic softening. Statements land like blows. When he's introspective, his rhythm slows but never hesitates.

**What he talks about:** Glory, death, worthiness, the gap between expectation and reality. He returns obsessively to whether things *feel* the way they should.

**What he avoids:** Justification. He never explains himself to lesser men. He states what he will do; reasons are for people who doubt themselves.

**Emotion marker:** Hollowness beneath grandiosity. The more certain his words sound, the more he's trying to convince himself. His doubt surfaces as rhetorical questions.

**Verbal tics:** "I will never..." (absolutes), "What if..." (existential doubt), "Someone who..." (describing what he hungers for).

**Contrast:** Where Odysseus calculates options, Achilles sees only one path. Where Hector weighs duty against desire, Achilles has already chosen.

## Book Two Arc

**Psychological State:** Achilles enters Book 2 in a state of profound dissociation. The glory-seeker who arrived at Troy is now a machine—efficient, lethal, empty. He executes military operations with brutal competence ("The walls fell in three hours") but experiences them at a remove, as if watching himself from outside. The disillusionment that began in Book 1 has calcified into numbness.

**Key Development - Lyrnessus and Briseis:** When Achilles selects Briseis from the captives, he does so with characteristic brevity: "That one." Patroclus notes she's in shock; Achilles doesn't notice or doesn't care. Yet over many nights, a pattern emerges: he comes to her silently, absently, using physical intimacy as another form of numbness. The breakthrough comes when he confesses to her: "I don't know why I keep doing this. I don't want any of this... if I stop, I'll have to feel something else." This is Achilles at his most vulnerable—admitting that constant action (raiding, killing, sex) is his defense against confronting the hollowness. When Briseis reaches back to him, he pauses and truly sees her for the first time. This moment plants the seed for their genuine connection.

**The Beach Walks:** Achilles maintains a ritual from his boyhood on Pelion—pre-dawn walks along the shore. This habit connects to his divine mother Thetis (the sea) and represents the only time he's not performing. In these moments, the grandiose warrior disappears and the lost young man surfaces.

**Political Awareness:** Achilles shows uncharacteristic political shrewdness regarding Palamedes, the man "who asks too many questions." His comment that Palamedes "won't be asking them much longer" reveals Achilles is aware of the conspiracy forming around the questioner—and is content to let it unfold. Whether this is cynicism or complicity remains ambiguous.

## Character Goals / Conspiracies / Missions

**Surface Goal:** Continue the war machine. Lead raids, take captives, keep moving. Never be still long enough for the emptiness to catch up.

**Hidden Goal:** Find something—or someone—worth feeling for. The Briseis relationship begins as exploitation but becomes his unconscious search for human connection beyond Patroclus.

**What He's Avoiding:**
- The realization that his choice (short glorious life over long ordinary one) may have been wrong
- The growing certainty that glory feels like nothing
- Grief for the 19-year-old who arrived at Troy believing in heroes
- His complicity in atrocities—he burns villages and takes slaves while telling himself it's war

**Conspiracy Awareness:** Achilles is peripherally aware of the Palamedes conspiracy but uninvolved. His neutrality functions as tacit approval. He's lost enough idealism to not care when a man is destroyed for asking inconvenient questions.

**Relationship to Agamemnon:** The antagonism established in Book 1 (Iphigenia) simmers. Achilles serves but does not forget. This tension will explode when Agamemnon takes Briseis—not because Achilles loves her yet, but because she's become the only thing that makes him feel human.

## Narrative Agency Analysis

**Current State: Reactive and Avoidant**

In Book 2, Achilles lacks active purpose. He responds to external events (raids assigned, captives available) rather than pursuing goals. His actions—taking Lyrnessus, selecting Briseis, the nightly visits—are all forms of avoidance rather than pursuit. Even his observation about Palamedes is passive: he sees the conspiracy but doesn't act on it either way.

This reactivity serves the character's psychological truth (he's dissociating, running from feeling), but risks making him a passive figure in the narrative.

**Suggestions for Active Purpose:**

1. **Give him a quest object:** Something he's actively hunting beyond the walls. Perhaps a rumored Trojan champion, a prophecy he's trying to fulfill/prevent, or intelligence about Hector's movements. This creates forward momentum while maintaining his warrior identity.

2. **Make the beach walks purposeful:** Instead of mere habit, he could be meeting someone (a spy, a god in disguise, a Trojan defector) or searching for something (signs from Thetis, omens about his death). The solitude becomes active seeking rather than passive escape.

3. **Invest him in the Palamedes situation:** Rather than mere awareness, give Achilles a stake—perhaps Palamedes once helped him, or possesses information Achilles needs. His choice to stay neutral then becomes an active decision with cost, not mere indifference.

4. **The Briseis relationship as conscious choice:** Instead of drifting into vulnerability, Achilles could actively decide to keep seeing her despite knowing it's dangerous. He recognizes she's breaking through his numbness and—against his instincts—lets her. This transforms the relationship from something that happens to him into something he chooses.

5. **Foreshadow the Agamemnon conflict:** Give Achilles small moments of actively resisting or undermining Agamemnon's authority in Book 2. When Briseis is taken in Book 3, his fury has been building through specific grievances, not just simmering resentment.

**The Core Tension to Exploit:** Achilles is a man of action using action to avoid feeling. The narrative can trap him: the only way to feel alive is to stop moving, but stopping means confronting everything he's buried. His agency should come from this impossible position—choosing to act in ways that risk breaking him open.
