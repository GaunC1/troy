# ACHILLES — "The Weapon"

**POV Status:** Primary (Every season)

**Starting State:** Young, beautiful, absolutely certain of his own glory. He knows he will die at Troy and has chosen this—fame over long life. He sees war as the stage for his legend.

**Arc:** Glory-seeker → Disillusioned soldier → Grief-shattered man → Death-seeker

**Core Tension:** He chose a short, glorious life. But glory feels hollow when his only real connection (Patroclus) is taken. By the end, he doesn't want to die gloriously anymore—he just wants to die.

## Motivation Evolution

- S1: Prove himself the greatest warrior who ever lived
- S2: Maintain his honor against Agamemnon's insults
- S3: Destroy everything Hector loves, then himself
- S4: Already dead inside, going through motions until Paris's arrow

## Key Relationships

- **Patroclus** — the only person who sees him as human, not a weapon
- **Agamemnon** — the king who treats him as a tool
- **Hector** — the mirror—everything Achilles could have been
- **Briseis** — the woman who shows him what he's become

## Book One Events

**Chapter 3 (The Oath):** Achilles agrees to join the expedition with his Myrmidons. His reputation precedes him - rumors call him half-divine, invulnerable, the greatest warrior of his generation - though at 19, he has never seen real battle. Agamemnon considers him for a marriage alliance with Iphigenia.

**Chapter 4 (The Blood Price):** At Aulis, Achilles trains obsessively at dawn, restless and worried the becalmed fleet means his choice of glory over long life was for nothing. He confides his existential fears to Patroclus. When Iphigenia arrives believing she will marry him, Achilles discovers Agamemnon used his name to lure her to sacrifice. He storms the king's tent, physically fighting through guards, and confronts Agamemnon in a pivotal scene that establishes their antagonism. Outmatched by Agamemnon's forces, Achilles vows he will never forget. That night, he makes Patroclus promise to kill him if he ever becomes like Agamemnon - putting necessity above honor. After the sacrifice, Achilles refuses to watch but hears everything. He sails for Troy haunted, vowing to never sacrifice his humanity for expedience.

**Chapter 5 (First Blood):** As Troy appears on the horizon, Achilles tells Patroclus he recognizes this as the place where he will die. He is first off the ship, killing 17 men in the beach landing with supernatural skill. He and Hector lock eyes across the battlefield - a moment of mutual recognition that foreshadows their fated conflict. Afterward, Achilles skips Agamemnon's council. He confesses disappointment in Hector: he hoped for someone who would just come at him without calculating. His hunger for a worthy opponent is established.

**Chapter 6 (The Wall):** Five years into the siege, Achilles has visibly changed - leaner, harder, something hungry in his eyes. He leads raids on Trojan villages for supplies, confessing to Odysseus that the work feels hollow. He came to fight warriors but is butchering farmers. His disillusionment deepens as he questions whether the walls will ever truly fall. The glory-seeker of Chapter 4 is becoming the disillusioned soldier of his arc.
