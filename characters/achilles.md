# ACHILLES — "The Weapon"

**POV Status:** Primary (Every season)

**Starting State:** Young, beautiful, absolutely certain of his own glory. He knows he will die at Troy and has chosen this—fame over long life. He sees war as the stage for his legend.

**Arc:** Glory-seeker → Disillusioned soldier → Grief-shattered man → Death-seeker

**Core Tension:** He chose a short, glorious life. But glory feels hollow when his only real connection (Patroclus) is taken. By the end, he doesn't want to die gloriously anymore—he just wants to die.

## Motivation Evolution

- S1: Prove himself the greatest warrior who ever lived
- S2: Maintain his honor against Agamemnon's insults
- S3: Destroy everything Hector loves, then himself
- S4: Already dead inside, going through motions until Paris's arrow

## Key Relationships

- **Patroclus** — the only person who sees him as human, not a weapon
- **Agamemnon** — the king who treats him as a tool
- **Hector** — the mirror—everything Achilles could have been
- **Briseis** — the woman who shows him what he's become

## Book One Events

**Chapter 3 (The Oath):** Achilles agrees to join the expedition with his Myrmidons. His reputation precedes him - rumors call him half-divine, invulnerable, the greatest warrior of his generation - though at 19, he has never seen real battle. Agamemnon considers him for a marriage alliance with Iphigenia.

**Chapter 4 (The Blood Price):** At Aulis, Achilles trains obsessively at dawn, restless and worried the becalmed fleet means his choice of glory over long life was for nothing. He confides his existential fears to Patroclus. When Iphigenia arrives believing she will marry him, Achilles discovers Agamemnon used his name to lure her to sacrifice. He storms the king's tent, physically fighting through guards, and confronts Agamemnon in a pivotal scene that establishes their antagonism. Outmatched by Agamemnon's forces, Achilles vows he will never forget. That night, he makes Patroclus promise to kill him if he ever becomes like Agamemnon - putting necessity above honor. After the sacrifice, Achilles refuses to watch but hears everything. He sails for Troy haunted, vowing to never sacrifice his humanity for expedience.

**Chapter 5 (First Blood):** As Troy appears on the horizon, Achilles tells Patroclus he recognizes this as the place where he will die. He is first off the ship, killing 17 men in the beach landing with supernatural skill. He and Hector lock eyes across the battlefield - a moment of mutual recognition that foreshadows their fated conflict. Afterward, Achilles skips Agamemnon's council. He confesses disappointment in Hector: he hoped for someone who would just come at him without calculating. His hunger for a worthy opponent is established.

**Chapter 6 (The Wall):** Five years into the siege, Achilles has visibly changed - leaner, harder, something hungry in his eyes. He leads raids on Trojan villages for supplies, confessing to Odysseus that the work feels hollow. He came to fight warriors but is butchering farmers. His disillusionment deepens as he questions whether the walls will ever truly fall. The glory-seeker of Chapter 4 is becoming the disillusioned soldier of his arc.

## Book 1 Audit

### Vocal Style Assessment

**Consistency: STRONG**

Achilles's voice remains consistent across his appearances in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. His dialogue is characterized by:

1. **Direct, unadorned speech** - He speaks in short, declarative sentences that reflect his identity as a warrior rather than a diplomat. Examples:
   - Ch. 4: "What have you done?" / "What have you *done*?"
   - Ch. 5: "After." / "I'm ready. I want to be ready."
   - Ch. 6: "Successful." / "Let them plan."

2. **Philosophical undercurrent** - Despite his bluntness, Achilles often reveals deeper existential concerns:
   - Ch. 4: "Is this what we are? Is this what all of you are? Kings and heroes who murder children and call it necessity?"
   - Ch. 5: "Someone who looks at me and doesn't calculate. Someone who just comes. Someone worth killing."
   - Ch. 6: "I came here to fight warriors... And instead I'm butchering farmers."

3. **Self-awareness about his nature** - He consistently understands himself as different:
   - Ch. 4: "Other men aren't Achilles." (to Patroclus)
   - Ch. 5: "I'm a strange person."

**One minor note:** In Chapter 4, when Achilles speaks about glory and his mother's prophecy, he is somewhat more verbose than in later chapters. This could be intentional (showing his younger, more idealistic self), but the shift is worth monitoring. The line "What does tonight feel like?" feels slightly more introspective than his usual speech pattern.

### Continuity Assessment

**No major errors detected.**

Information flow is well-managed:

1. **Knowledge of his fate** - Properly introduced. In Ch. 4, he tells Patroclus about his mother's prophecy (stay home and live long, or go to Troy and die young with glory). In Ch. 5, when he first sees Troy, he says "My mother said I'd know. When I saw it. The place where I'm going to die." This builds correctly on established information.

2. **Relationship with Agamemnon** - Properly seeded. The confrontation in Ch. 4 over Iphigenia establishes their antagonism before the Briseis conflict (which will come in later books).

3. **Reputation vs. Reality** - In Ch. 3, the Mycenaean messenger tells Odysseus that "Achilles has agreed to join the expedition" and Odysseus reflects on rumors about Achilles being half-divine/invulnerable, noting "he'd also heard that Achilles was nineteen years old and had never seen a real battle." This correctly establishes Achilles's status before we see him in action.

4. **Timeline** - The five-year jump between Ch. 5 and Ch. 6 is clearly marked. Physical description notes the change ("leaner, harder, something hungry in his eyes that hadn't been there before"), which properly reflects the passage of time.

### Arc Strengthening Opportunities

**The arc is working well, but there are opportunities to deepen it:**

1. **The promise to Patroclus** (Ch. 4) is excellent setup. When Achilles asks Patroclus to kill him if he ever becomes like Agamemnon, this plants crucial seeds for his later arc. Consider: Could this promise be echoed or referenced again in Book 1? Perhaps a moment in Ch. 6 where Achilles catches himself doing something that makes him think of this promise?

2. **The Hector moment in Ch. 5** is strong but could be amplified. When their eyes meet across the battlefield and Achilles is "disappointed" that Hector calculated rather than just charged - this is great characterization. However, it's told rather than shown. Consider whether Achilles could have a line of dialogue about this to Patroclus that reveals more about what he wants from Hector specifically.

3. **Missing: His reaction to the Iphigenia sacrifice itself.** In Ch. 4, we see Achilles storm Agamemnon's tent, confront him, and leave. We see him talking to Odysseus after. We see his conversation with Patroclus that night. But we don't see him during the actual sacrifice. The text says "I didn't watch. I couldn't" but we hear nothing about what he did experience - the sound of it, what it was like to be there and choose not to look. This feels like a missed opportunity to show his humanity and establish the moral wound this war inflicts on him before it even begins.

4. **The disillusionment in Ch. 6 works, but could be sharper.** Achilles's confession to Odysseus that the work "feels hollow" is good, but it's somewhat abstract. The specific detail of what he did in the village raid is kept off-page (we see aftermath through Hector's POV, not Achilles's). Consider: would one moment of specificity - a face, an image, something that sticks with him - make his disillusionment more visceral?

5. **Patroclus as anchor** - The relationship is well-established, but nearly every Achilles scene includes Patroclus. This works for showing their bond, but consider whether one scene of Achilles alone might reveal a different dimension of his character - who is he when his "only person who sees him as human" isn't there?

### What's Working Well

- **The Agamemnon confrontation in Ch. 4** is a standout scene. Achilles's physical assault on the guards, his genuine moral outrage, and the exchange where Agamemnon says "Grudges make men fight harder" all effectively establish the central conflict.

- **The vow to Patroclus** ("If I ever become like him... kill me yourself") is perfect setup for later tragedy.

- **The first-off-the-ship moment in Ch. 5** earns his reputation. Seventeen kills in the beach landing, described with supernatural efficiency, makes his legend feel real.

- **The eye contact with Hector** in Ch. 5 effectively foreshadows their fated conflict without being heavy-handed.

- **The hollow victory in Ch. 6** - His line "I came here to fight warriors... And instead I'm butchering farmers" perfectly captures the transition from "glory-seeker" to "disillusioned soldier."

### Summary

Achilles is well-rendered in Book 1. His voice is consistent, his arc progresses logically from young idealist to someone beginning to question the cost of glory, and his key relationships (Patroclus, Agamemnon, the absent Hector) are properly established. The main opportunities for strengthening involve adding specificity to his emotional experiences - particularly during the Iphigenia sacrifice and the village raids - and possibly giving him one scene of solitude to show who he is when Patroclus isn't there to reflect him back to himself.
