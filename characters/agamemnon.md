# AGAMEMNON — "The King"

**POV Status:** Secondary (Seasons 1-2)

The high king who holds the Greeks together through sheer political force. Arrogant, greedy, insecure. Takes Briseis from Achilles not because he wants her but because Achilles cannot be allowed to defy him. His murder of Iphigenia haunts him—not because he regrets it, but because it worked, and he knows he'd do it again.

*POV fades after Season 2 as he becomes more obstacle than protagonist. Returns briefly in the finale to die at Clytemnestra's hands.*

## Book One Events

**Chapter 1:** Mentioned only in passing when Menelaus jokes that his brother "Agamemnon could use some" humility.

**Chapter 2:** Referenced by Hector as the true threat behind the coming war: "Agamemnon has wanted an excuse to move against us for years. Now Paris has handed him one wrapped in gold."

**Chapter 3:** Announces Helen's abduction to his family and declares he will lead the expedition. Promises his daughter Iphigenia she will meet the hero Achilles after the war. Presides over the council at Aulis, delivering a rousing speech about Greek honor and the need to punish Troy. When the fleet is becalmed, he learns from the priest Calchas that Artemis demands his daughter's life as payment.

**Chapter 4:** The moral center of this chapter. After a night of cold calculation, Agamemnon chooses Troy over Iphigenia, writing a false letter to lure her to Aulis under the pretense of marrying Achilles. When Achilles confronts him in rage over the deception, Agamemnon defends himself without remorse: "I'm going to do what must be done." He performs the sacrifice himself, watches Clytemnestra's silent vow of vengeance, then washes his hands and feels nothing. His thoughts turn immediately to victory and glory.

**Chapter 6:** Five years into the siege, Odysseus notes that Agamemnon "had aged badly" since Aulis, his fire dimmed into exhaustion. He approves Achilles's raids on Trojan villages to solve supply shortages.

**Character Development:** Book One establishes Agamemnon as a man capable of any cruelty in service of ambition. The Iphigenia sacrifice is the defining moment, revealing a ruler who can murder his own child and feel nothing because "it worked." His relationship with Clytemnestra is irreparably destroyed in a single glance across the altar. By Chapter 6, the war he sacrificed everything for has become a grinding siege that has visibly worn him down.

## Book 1 Speech Samples

### Voice Mechanics

**Sentence structure:** Declarative statements of what *will* happen, not what *might*. Lists of actions without emotional connective tissue ("You take her. You put her on a ship. You sail away."). When challenged, his sentences grow longer but remain absolutely certain.

**Tense:** Future tense for his plans, present tense for justification. He rarely looks backward—what's done is done and served its purpose.

**Rhythm:** Mild and unhurried, especially when saying terrible things. The worse the content, the calmer the delivery. He never raises his voice; volume is for men who doubt themselves.

**What he talks about:** Necessity. The expedition. What "must" be done. He frames self-interest as duty to Greece, personal ambition as collective need.

**What he avoids:** Guilt. He doesn't defend his choices by saying they were hard—he defends them by saying they were obvious. No tortured conscience, no "I had no choice." He had a choice. He made it. Next problem.

**Emotion marker:** Complete absence of affect when discussing atrocity. His voice is warmest when speaking to Iphigenia (before the altar), coldest when describing what he's about to do to her.

**Verbal tics:** "What must be done" (necessity as moral shield), "The war requires it" (externalizing responsibility), dismissing others' objections by reframing them as weakness.

**Contrast:** Where Odysseus calculates quietly, Agamemnon declares openly. Where Hector carries guilt, Agamemnon has moved past it entirely.
