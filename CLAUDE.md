# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a creative writing project: a literary retelling of the Trojan War written as a "graded reader" (educational book series). The story adapts Homer's Iliad and the Epic Cycle into a Game of Thrones-style narrative with multiple POV characters, morally ambiguous protagonists, and unflinching depictions of war's consequences.

## Project Structure

- `troy_storyboard.md` - Master planning document containing:
  - Core philosophy (pacing, death style, morality)
  - Complete season/episode breakdown (4 seasons, 6 episodes each)
  - Character death schedule
  - Key themes and visual motifs
  - Source material integration notes

- `characters/` - Individual character profiles (one per file)
  - Primary: `achilles.md`, `hector.md`, `odysseus.md`, `helen.md`, `cassandra.md`
  - Secondary: `agamemnon.md`, `paris.md`, `briseis.md`, `priam.md`, `andromache.md`

- `troy_book1/` - Book One: "The Gathering Storm" (Season 1)
  - Chapters follow the storyboard's episode structure
  - File naming convention: `troy_book1_chapter[N]_[status].md`
  - Status indicators: `draft`, `v2`, `v3`, `final`

## Writing Style Guidelines

**Narrative approach:**
- Multiple POV characters per chapter, separated by `---` dividers
- Present tense for visions/prophecies (Cassandra), past tense for main narrative
- Chapter titles match storyboard episode titles
- Each chapter opens with `# THE FALL OF TROY` followed by book/chapter headers

**Tone:**
- "Slow burn with sudden eruptions" - political maneuvering punctuated by violence
- Deaths are anticlimactic, not heroic - characters die confused or simply stop
- No clear heroes; everyone believes they're justified
- Gods appear rarely and indirectly (effects, dreams, glimpses)

**Character voices:**
- Achilles: grandiose, certain, increasingly hollow
- Hector: measured, pragmatic, carrying hidden despair
- Odysseus: observational, calculating, morally compromised
- Helen: detached, guilt-laden, quietly defiant
- Cassandra: dreamlike, fragmented, exhausted rather than mad
- Paris: uncertain, defensive, occasionally self-aware

## Source Material

The storyboard integrates material from:
- The Iliad and Odyssey (primary)
- Cyclic Epics: Cypria, Aethiopis, Little Iliad, Iliou Persis, Nostoi
- Euripides' plays (Trojan Women, Hecuba, Andromache, Helen)
- Virgil's Aeneid and Ovid's Metamorphoses

Deliberate departures from tradition are documented in the storyboard's appendix.

## Working with This Project

When editing chapters:
- Consult the storyboard for plot points, character arcs, and thematic requirements
- Maintain POV consistency within sections
- Preserve the established voice for each character
- Keep scene breaks consistent with storyboard episode outlines

When the file status changes (e.g., draft to v2), update the filename accordingly.
